# VMware Tanzu Developer Center

## Building the Site

The VMware Tanzu Developer Center uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site from Markdown files. You'll need to [get Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) if you want to build and run the site locally.

### Run locally

To install the latest version of `hugo` you can use `brew install hugo` if you are on a Mac. However, this site currently requires a specific version (0.69.2) to build successfully. To install this version of `hugo`, use one of the following two commands:

Using `brew`:

```
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/5c50ad9cf3b3145b293edbc01e7fa88583dd0024/Formula/hugo.rb"
brew install hugo.rb
# To keep this version around if you upgrade
brew pin hugo
```

Or to directly download:

```
wget "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.69.2/hugo_extended_0.69.2_Linux-64bit.tar.gz"
tar -zxvf "hugo_extended_0.69.2_Linux-64bit.tar.gz"
mv ./hugo /usr/local/bin/
```

Now you're ready to build locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal
cd tanzu-dev-portal
make preview
```

A preview of the dev portal will be available at: [http://localhost:1313/developer](http://localhost:1313/developer).

### Run tests locally

> Note: requires Docker to be running (On Mac OS X requires Docker Desktop 2.4 or newer)

1. Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation) (`brew install act`)
2. Run `make test`

#### Spell Check

A GitHub action will run after opening a Pull Request that checks spelling. (You may test this locally using `make spell`.) You can add entries to the `custom_dict.txt` file for words that should not be flagged. This file gets sorted as a pre-commit hook so you can just add your entries to the end of the file and not worry about the order.

### Publish to Staging

After running and testing locally, opened Pull Requests will be automatically staged by Netlify.
