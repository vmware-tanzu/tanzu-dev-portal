## About The Project

![Tanzu Developer Center Screen Shot](static/images/github/homepage-screenshot.png)

The VMware Tanzu Developer Center is a site specifically built to be a great resource for software development teams. The contributions on the Tanzu Developer Center are from teams across VMware, as well as individuals without.

Our guiding principle is to ensure readers have free, immediate access to all the content on the Tanzu Developer Center. No purchase is ever necessary to access content on the Tanzu Developer Center because it is either open source or an easily accessible trial.


### Site Built With

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


## Getting Started Building a Local Deployment of the Tanzu Developer Center

Before you can build a local copy of the Tanzu Developer Center, there are software prerequisites that you’re going to need to install.

### Software Installation Prerequisites

* **Install Hugo** — The VMware Tanzu Developer Center uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site from Markdown files. You'll need to [get Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) if you want to build and run the site locally. Make sure you install the extended version with built in SCSS/SASS support. This site pins hugo to a specific version (currently **0.82.0**) to build so if you're using a different version, your experience may vary. To install this version: 

   - Download the correct binary for your OS from [gohugo GitHub releases page for 0.82.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.82.0). 
   - Move the `hugo` binary to an appropriate location and/or add it to your `PATH`.

* **Install NPM** — Hugo uses NPM to manage its local packages. If you don’t already have it installed, you’ll need it to move further.

     ```sh
     brew install npm
     ```

* **Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)** — Used to runs GitHub Action’s tests locally. The Tanzu Developer Center uses GitHub Actions to perform automated testing periodically, and on pull requests. 

     **NOTE**: The tests currently break on `act` > [v0.2.20, be sure to install v0.2.20](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/tag/v0.2.20).

* **Install Docker** — Used to build images for local automated tests.  

    **NOTE:** (Mac OS X requires Docker Desktop 2.4, or later)

     ```sh
     brew install docker --cask
     ```

### Run a Local Copy of the Tanzu Developer Center

To get a local copy of the Tanzu Developer Center up and running follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository.

     ```sh
     git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal.git
     ```

2. Build a preview of the website. The website will be available at [`http://localhost:1313/developer`](http://localhost:1313/developer).
    
     ```sh
     make preview
     ```


## Troubleshooting

### Q. I'm receiving an error about cloning `themes/docsy`

With the change with how the theme files are overridden, the first time you update your branch you may see the following issue when running `make preview`:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
Submodule 'themes/docsy' (https://github.com/google/docsy.git) registered for path 'themes/docsy'
fatal: not a git repository: /private/tmp/tanzu-dev-portal/themes/docsy/../../.git/modules/themes/docsy
Failed to clone 'themes/docsy'. Retry scheduled
BUG: submodule considered for cloning, doesn't need cloning any more?
fatal: could not get a repository handle for submodule 'themes/docsy'
make: *** [theme] Error 1
```

You can run the following command for a one-time fix:

```
rm -rf .git/modules && rm -rf themes/docsy && mkdir themes/docsy
```

### Q. `make preview` is throwing a `fatal error: pipe failed` error

This is due to the number of files that are opened during the process of building the site. If you're on OSX, this can be addressed with the following command:

```
sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65535 200000
ulimit -n 65535
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=100000
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65535
```

### Q. I am on Windows and `make preview` doesn't work

On Windows, you may need to use `hugo server -D` to start the application. The site will then be available on `http://localhost:1313/`
