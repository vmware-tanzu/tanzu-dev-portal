## About The Project

![Tanzu Developer Center Screen Shot](static/images/github/homepage-screenshot.png)

The VMware Tanzu Developer Center is VMware's site built specifically with developer teams in mind. Above all, our guiding principles for content included on the Tanzu Developer Center is that if the reader is excited about a topic, they don't have to contact a sales rep or purchase a pricey license because all content in the Tanzu Developer Center is immediately actionable, either because it is open source, or there is an easily accessible trial. Above all, we want the Tanzu Developer Center to be a great resource for software development teams. 

Beyond this, the Tanzu Developer Center is fully open source, and contributions from all teams within VMware, as well as individuals without. Check out the [contributing](#contributing) section below for more details.


### Built With

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install hugo**. The VMware Tanzu Developer Center uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to build the site from Markdown files. You'll need to [get Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) if you want to build and run the site locally. Make sure you install the extended version with SCSS/SASS support built in. This site pins hugo to a specific version (currently 0.82.0) to build so if you're using a different version, your experience may vary. To install this specific version, see the [gohugo GitHub releases page for 0.82.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.82.0).

     ```bash
     brew install hugo
     ```

2. **Install NPM**. Hugo uses NPM to manage its local packages. If you donâ€™t already have it installed, you will need it to move further.

     ```bash
     brew install npm
     ```

3. **Install act**. [act](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/tag/v0.2.20) is used to run GitHub Actions tests locally. The Tanzu Developer Center uses GitHub Actions to perform automated testing periodically, and on each pull request. **NOTE**: Currently, the tests break on `act` > v0.2.20, be sure to install [v0.2.20](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/tag/v0.2.20).)

4. Install Docker. Running automated test locally will require Docker to be running (On Mac OS X requires Docker Desktop 2.4 or newer)

     ```bash
     brew install docker --cask
     ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

     ```bash
     git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal.git
     ```

2. Build a preview of the website. The website will be available at `http://localhost:1313/developer`.
    
     ```bash
     make preview
     ```
