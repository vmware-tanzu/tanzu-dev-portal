We highly recommend your product team be a [balanced team](/learningpaths/application-development/balanced-teams) made up of a product manager, designer, and some number of engineers. Sometimes, however, your team may not have a dedicated designer who is able to [design in an agile environment](https://tanzu.vmware.com/design), think through user experiences, [facilitate and synthesize research](/practices/research-synthesis), and develop designs for the team to implement‚Äîbut it may want one. This guide will help teams who‚Äôd like to bring on a design contractor or vendor and need help interviewing, evaluating, and onboarding a designer but aren‚Äôt sure how to go about doing that.

_If you need help convincing your team or leadership to contract with a designer on a time-and-materials basis vs. a fixed-deliverable basis, check back soon for our upcoming blog post on **Advocating for Outcome-Oriented Vendor Contracts** with tips on how to approach this conversation._

## Preparing for and running interviews üîé


### Key hiring considerations

These key hiring considerations are intended to help support any hiring conversations with prospective **design contractors** but could easily be repurposed to help with hiring a full-time designer. The list includes areas to investigate and, where appropriate, some sample questions that are rooted in asking about what the designer has _done_ as opposed to asking them to _speculate on the future_.


### Things to look for and ask about

1. Values collaboration across disciplines (e.g., wants to pair with developers to implement designs)

   > ‚ÄúTell me a bit about how you worked with [PM/engineer] on this project?‚Äù
   >
   > ‚ÄúTell me a bit about your favorite [PM/engineer] working style? What do you like about it?"

2. Gets excited about shipping software vs. ‚Äújust making designs‚Äù

   > ‚ÄúWhat are your strategies for balancing between building ideal features and shipping production software?‚Äù

3. Is able to start small and iterate vs. doing ‚Äúbig design up front‚Äù (i.e., solving for all things at once)

   > ‚ÄúWalk me through the process you took to reach this design.‚Äù

4. Advocates for getting user feedback on design decisions and is confident leading user research

   > ‚ÄúCan you elaborate more on the research you did [on feature/in phase]?
   >
   > ‚ÄúCan you provide some examples of things you learned in research that you did not expect? How did this impact your design strategy or the product plan?‚Äù

5. Has strong, but loosely held, opinions (i.e., is willing to push for things they think are right but is just as willing to compromise in the face of new information)

   > ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you had a different opinion about [a feature/a direction] than others on your team. How did you navigate that?‚Äù

6. Has familiarity with the design tools that the team is using

## Possible hiring logistics/flow

This set of hiring logistics is intended to give one possible fast approach to hiring a design contractor into a team that does not have a designer but does have a product manager-like role and/or at least one engineer. Naturally this will vary based on how much recruiting/sourcing is done by you vs. by a partner agency, and it can always be adjusted to fit the parameters of your existing hiring processes. A general flow might include these touch-points with the option to simplify further as time and availability require:

1. Initial screening by you **OR** partner agency locates a potential candidate
   * Decision (move forward or end)
2. Portfolio review **AND** cross-discipline chat **OR** hands-on activity
   * Decision (extend offer or end)

Additional explanations of each of the activities can be found below.

### Before interviewing


<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Goal</strong></td>
        <td>Clarify the type of work you‚Äôre looking for this designer to do</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Flow</strong></td>
        <td>Define (loosely) the areas you want your design contractor to help explore.
            <p>
                Review the road map; has anything changed?
            <p>
                Suggest writing down answers to these questions for use in screening and portfolio review either as guidelines or as guardrails.
            <ul>
                <li>Where is the product in its lifecycle? (e.g., pre-launch, launched, etc.)
                <li>What are the major things this contractor will help the team solve?
                <li>What would a successful hire look like? An unsuccessful one?
            </ul>
        </td>

### Initial screening
30 minutes if run by a product manager; N/A if run by partner agency

_Note: If done by a partner agency, prep the agency with a high-level overview of the desired designer_

### Option 2: Hands-on activity
30‚Äì45 minutes run by a product manager (or similar)

                <li>Intros if needed
                <li>Set up the goal of the discussion: <em>‚ÄúFor this session, we‚Äôre going to collaborate on solving a real user problem. We may not get all the way to a solution, but that‚Äôs OK. I‚Äôm mostly looking to get a sense of how you approach the problem.‚Äù</em>

            <ul>
                <li>Ask about a problem that is top of mind for the team (especially if it‚Äôs one that has recently been discussed or even solved; it doesn‚Äôt have to be brand new).
                    <br/><br/>
                    For example, if you are working on a tool that helps visualize data and you want to extend the existing visualizations to add additional data, you could give a bit of context about that then ask <em>‚ÄúWhere do you think we should start?‚Äù</em>
                <li>If appropriate, share a link to artifacts (a QA site, a design mock, etc.) so candidate can get context
                <li>Go as far as you‚Äôre able in the time available toward a lean solution

### Key design artifacts for new hires

Once you‚Äôve hired a design contractor or vendor, it‚Äôs critical to get them up-to-speed on your work. This is a non-comprehensive list of design and team artifacts that a new designer would likely appreciate having access to as they onboard.

* Overview and access to the [team‚Äôs road map and backlog of work](/practices/outcome-oriented-roadmap)
* Location of the team‚Äôs collaborative visual work (e.g., [Miro](https://miro.com/), [Mural](https://www.mural.co/), etc.), pointing out anything that is specifically design-oriented (e.g., [design critiques](/practices/design-critique) or brainstorming activities)
* Location where any existing designs live (e.g., [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), etc.)
* Overview, if possible, of how those designs are laid out (e.g., if there are multiple pages, what is the purpose of each?) so the design contractor can get up to speed quickly
* Location, if any, where any existing [research notes or synthesis](/practices/research-synthesis) has taken place
* Location of a shared team drive (e.g., Google Drive, Sharepoint, etc.), pointing out any design-oriented folders they should know about
* Location of any special fonts or other design artifacts (e.g., videos, stock images, logos, etc.) that the designer may need to use


### Areas for design exploration

Here are a few questions the team can ask to help identify upcoming work that could benefit from dedicated design thinking. The goal is to point the designer in the right direction‚Äîand/or, if you‚Äôre early in the process, to help justify why you need a design contractor in the first place.

* Is there a problem or solution you identified during a [Discovery and Framing](/practices/?filters=discovery,framing) that wasn‚Äôt a priority then but is quickly becoming the next priority now?
* Is there a feature set you‚Äôve already implemented in a lean way that you need to extend to make even more impactful?
* Were there any recent [research learnings](/practices/research-synthesis) that the team has found particularly compelling but which have taken a back seat to other in-flight priorities?
* Is there another [persona](/practices/personas) whose experience the team is ready to investigate further?
* Are there mobile/tablet considerations that the team is ready to optimize for?
* Is there anything lingering in the ‚Äúunprioritized‚Äù section of the [team road map](/practices/outcome-oriented-roadmap) that is worth digging into via some sort of research?
