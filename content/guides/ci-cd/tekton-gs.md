## Before You Begin

There's just a few things you'll need for this guide:

- [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/): Tekton runs on Kubernetes, so to keep things simple, this guide will assume you're using Minikube to get up and running quickly
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account: You'll use this registry to push up container images built from your pipelines.
- The [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli)

## Setting Up Tekton

While Tekton can run on any Kubernetes cluster, this guide will walk through with the assumption that you will be using Minikube. If you'd prefer to run Tekton differently, make sure to reference the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md).

First, create a Minikube cluster with 4GB of memory and 10GB of storage:

```bash
minikube start --memory=4096 --disk-size=10g
```

Once your Minikube environment is created, you can install Tekton by applying the YAML from the [latest release](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases):

Install Tekton
```bash
kubectl apply --filename https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
```

You can monitor the progress of the install by watching the pods in the newly created `tekton-pipelines` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace tekton-pipelines --watch
```

Once the install is complete, you'll see two newly created pods: 

```bash
tekton-pipelines-webhook-69796f78cf-b28z4      1/1     Running             0          9s
tekton-pipelines-controller-6d55778887-df59t   1/1     Running             0          13s
```

Finally, in a couple of the examples, you'll be pushing up container images to Docker Hub, so create a secret that Tekton can use to log into Docker Hub with, substituting the placeholder values with your own:

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockercreds --docker-server=https://index.docker.io/v1/ --docker-username=<DOCKERHUB_USERNAME> --docker-password=<DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD> --docker-email <DOCKERHUB_EMAIL>
```


## Create Your Own Task

What better place to start than with a good 'ole "Hello World" example? For this example, you'll start with the most basic building block of a pipeline: a task. This task will simply start up a container, write "Hello World", and end:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: echo-hello-world
spec:
  steps:
    - name: echo
      image: ubuntu
      command:
        - echo
      args:
        - "Hello World"
```

Take a moment to digest this a bit. While a `task` can become much more complex than this, this specific task has no inputs, no outputs, and just a single step. That step (named `echo`) uses the [Ubuntu image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu), and executes the following command:

`echo "Hello World"`

Tekton automatically stores logs of all tasks that are ran, so even though the container that will run this will tasks will quickly go away, you can reference the results of that task after the fact.

In order to actually run this task though, you need to create one more resource, a `TaskRun`. `TaskRun` resources define how to run specific tasks. Consider the following for this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: echo-hello-world-task-run
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: echo-hello-world
```

Again, keeping the example as simple as possible, `TaskRun` definitions _could_ fill in any parameters required by a `Task`, but in this case since the tasks to run takes no parameters, it simply refers to it by name: `echo-hello-world`.

As with any Kubernetes CRD, this can all be defined in one file, which you can find all put together on [GitHub](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/tekton-examples/blob/master/hello-task.yml), and use to apply these two examples directly:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianMMcClain/tekton-examples/master/hello-task.yml
```

Even if ran quickly, if you run `kubectl get pods`, you'll see this task probably already completed:

```bash
NAME                                  READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
echo-hello-world-task-run-pod-vm6f5   0/1     Completed   0          12s
```

As mentioned though, Tekton stores the results of a `TaskRun`, and that's where the [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli) comes in. First, checkout Tekton's description of your `TaskRun`:

```bash
tkn taskrun describe echo-hello-world-task-run
```

```bash
Name:        echo-hello-world-task-run
Namespace:   default
Task Ref:    echo-hello-world
Timeout:     1h0m0s
Labels:
 app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=tekton-pipelines
 tekton.dev/task=echo-hello-world

This is a bit bare since the task has no inputs, outputs, or resources. What's important though is that the `Status` is set to `Succeeded`. Great! Next, take a look of the output from the output of that `TaskRun`:

```bash
tkn taskrun logs echo-hello-world-task-run
```

```bash
[echo] Hello World
```

Just as you may expected, the output of the `echo` task was `Hello World`. 

## Building a Container with Kaniko

The "Hello World" example is great and all, but what about something a bit more realistic? Since Tekton is a tool for automating CI/CD pipelines, you may expect to be able to create and publish container images. For this next example, you'll use [Kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), a tool used to build container images from a Dockerfile on top of Kubernetes. Kaniko provides it's own container image that you can use as a base, adding your own code and Dockerfile, and Kaniko will build and publish a container image based on your Dockerfile.

You can see the complete example [here on GitHub](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/tekton-examples/blob/master/kaniko-task.yml).

First, since you'll be pushing the resulting container image to Docker Hub, you'll need to create a service account that uses the secret that you created earlier:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: dockerhub-service
secrets:
  - name: dockercreds
```

Next, you'll need to define one input for the code that will be built, and one output that defines where to publish the container image:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: sinatra-hello-world-git
spec:
  type: git
  params:
    - name: revision
      value: master
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/sinatra-hello-world
```

This introduces a new concept, a `PipelineResource`, which defines am input into, or an output from, a `Task`. If you want to learn more about, make sure to check out the [`PipelineResource` documentation](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/resources.md). This `PipelineResource` is of type `git`, which points to the master branch of the code to build on GitHub. It also gives it the name `sinatra-hello-world-git`, which is what will be used to reference it later on in the example.

You'll need one `PipelineResource`, one to define where to publish the container image:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: sinatra-hello-world-tekton-demo-image
spec:
  type: image
  params:
    - name: url
      value: <DOCKER_USERNAME>/sinatra-hello-world-tekton-demo
```

This `PipelineResource` is of type `image`, as in a container image. It's also been given the name `sinatra-hello-world-tekton-demo-image`. In this case, it simply takes the image name and tag. Since no full URL is provided, it's assumed that it will be published to Docker Hub, but you can also point to your own container registry.

**NOTE:** Make sure to replace <DOCKER_USERNAME> with your Docker Hub username

With your input and output defined, it's finally time to create the `Task` that will build the container. Take some time to carefully read this through:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: build-docker-image-from-git-source
spec:
  params:
    - name: pathToDockerFile
      type: string
      description: The path to the dockerfile to build
      default: $(resources.inputs.docker-source.path)/Dockerfile
    - name: pathToContext
      type: string
      description: |
        The build context used by Kaniko
        (https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#kaniko-build-contexts)
      default: $(resources.inputs.docker-source.path)
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: docker-source
        type: git
    outputs:
      - name: builtImage
        type: image
  steps:
    - name: build-and-push
      image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:v0.17.1
      # specifying DOCKER_CONFIG is required to allow kaniko to detect docker credential
      env:
        - name: "DOCKER_CONFIG"
          value: "/tekton/home/.docker/"
      command:
        - /kaniko/executor
      args:
        - --dockerfile=$(params.pathToDockerFile)
        - --destination=$(resources.outputs.builtImage.url)
        - --context=$(params.pathToContext)
```

Here, a new `Task` named `build-docker-image-from-git-source` is created. The best way to understand this is to walk through the `spec` piece-by-piece.

First, there are two `params` that the Task will expect:

1. `pathToDockerFile`: Where the Dockerfile is in your code, defaulting to the root directory.
2. `pathToContext`: The directory that Kaniko should look for your code in. If no alternative directory is provided, it assumes that the root directory of your code is the build context.

Next, it defines two `resources` that it expects. It expects one `input` (which it will refer to as `docker-source`) of type `git`. It also expects one `output` (referred to as `builtImage`) of type `image`. As a reminder, a `Task` is simply outlining what inputs and output it expects, but it's not yet defining them. You may expect that these will match the two `PipelineResource` objects that were defined earlier, and you'd be right. The final piece of YAML that you'll define later will tie the two together.

Finally, the `Task` needs to define what `steps` to take. Since Kaniko contains all of the logic it needs inside the container image, there's just a single step. Using the Kaniko container image, this step runs the `/kaniko/executor` image with three flags: `--dockerfile`, `--destination`, and `--context`. Each of these flags take in the information defined in the `params` and `resources` sections.

Phew, that was a lot to digest. Take a moment and make sure you understand each of these sections. At a high level, this `Task` takes two parameters with two inputs and runs one executable.

Now there's one final piece, which is the `TaskRunner` to run this `Task`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-docker-image-from-git-source-task-run
spec:
  serviceAccountName: dockerhub-service
  taskRef:
    name: build-docker-image-from-git-source
  params:
    - name: pathToDockerFile
      value: Dockerfile
  resources:
    inputs:
      - name: docker-source
        resourceRef:
          name: sinatra-hello-world-git
    outputs:
      - name: builtImage
        resourceRef:
          name: sinatra-hello-world-tekton-demo-image
```

This `TaskRun` object says that you want to run the `build-docker-image-from-git-source` `Task` that you just defined and provide the two `PipelineResource` objects that you defined as `resources`. This is how Tekton knows that it should use the `sinatra-hello-world-git` `PipelineResource` for the `docker-source` for example.

One other thing to notice is that the `pathToDockerFile` parameter was defined, despite being the same as the default value. This is done to show how `params` are defined in `TaskRun` objects, but also note that `pathToContext` is omitted. If `params` have a default value, they do not necessarily need to be defined in your `TaskRun`.

If you want an easy way apply this all at once, you can store your Docker Hub username in a Bash variable:

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
```

Then you can run the following one-liner to apply all of the objects at once:

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianMMcClain/tekton-examples/master/kaniko-task.yml | sed -e "s/\<DOCKER_USERNAME\>/$DOCKER_USERNAME/" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Once applied, make sure to check the status of the `TaskRun` using the Tekton CLI:

```bash
tkn taskrun describe build-docker-image-from-git-source-task-run
```

```bash
ame:              build-docker-image-from-git-source-task-run
Namespace:         default
Task Ref:          build-docker-image-from-git-source
Service Account:   dockerhub-service

üöó Sidecars

No sidecars
```

In this case, it looks like the `Status` is already `Running`, great! Take a look at the logs to monitor the build:

```bash
tkn taskrun logs build-docker-image-from-git-source-task-run -f
```

If all goes well, once the logs finish, you should see your new image up in Docker Hub!

## Cloud-Native Buildpacks

So far, you've been defining your own tasks and steps to run. One of the benefits of Tekton's design however is that since each component is shareable through YAML files, you can plug in a `Task` developed by someone else. For this example, you'll be bringing in a `Task` that's already defined, specifically one to [use Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://github.com/tektoncd/catalog/tree/master/buildpacks). If you're unfamiliar with Cloud Native Buildpacks, make sure to check out [Cloud Native Buildpacks: What Are They?](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/containers/cnb-what-is/).

To install the `Task`, you can use `kubectl apply`, passing the URL to the YAML directly:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/master/buildpacks/buildpacks-v3.yaml
```

Much like how you can use the Tekton CLI to describe a `TaskRun`, you can also use to describe a `Task` to see what resources, parameters, and steps it defines:

```bash
tkn task describe buildpacks-v3
```

```bash
Name:        buildpacks-v3
Namespace:   default

build-spring-api-with-buildpacks   18 hours ago   7 minutes   Succeeded
```

Here you can see this `Task` expects an input resource of type `git` and an output resource of type `image`. You can define these just as you did in the previous example. For this one, you'll be building a different application, [this one being built in Spring](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/spring-boot-api-demo). Start by creating the Service Account to authenticate against Docker Hub, the input `git` resource, and the output `image` resource:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: dockerhub-service
secrets:
  - name: regcred # Create secret for your container registry

---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: spring-api-git
spec:
  type: git
  params:
    - name: revision
      value: master
    - name: url
      value: https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/spring-boot-api-demo

---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineResource
metadata:
  name: spring-api-tekton-demo
spec:
  type: image
  params:
    - name: url
      value: <DOCKER_USERNAME>/spring-api-tekton-demo
```

This should all look familiar to the previous example. The service account uses the secret defined at the beginning of the guide, the `git` `PipelineResource` points to the code that you'll be building, and the `image` `PipelineResource` will tell Tekton where to send the resulting image.

Finally, define the `TaskRun` to tie it all together:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: build-spring-api-with-buildpacks
spec:
  serviceAccountName: dockerhub-service
  taskRef:
    name: buildpacks-v3
  inputs:
    resources:
    - name: source
      resourceRef:
        name: spring-api-git
    params:
    - name: BUILDER_IMAGE
      value: cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic
  outputs:
    resources:
    - name: image
      resourceRef:
        name: spring-api-tekton-demo
```

As you may have expected, this denotes your two `PipelineResource` objects as the input and output resources. It also declare that you'll be using the `cloudfoundry/cnb:bionic` image for the buildpack builder.

Much like with the previous example, you can apply this all at once by first storing your Docker Hub username in a Bash variable:

```bash
export DOCKER_USERNAME=DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
```

Then, you can apply the YAML directly:

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianMMcClain/tekton-examples/master/cnb-spring-api-demo.yml | sed -e "s/\<DOCKER_USERNAME\>/$DOCKER_USERNAME/" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Check the status with `tkn taskrun describe`:

```bash
tkn taskrun describe build-spring-api-with-buildpacks
```

```bash
Name:              build-spring-api-with-buildpacks

You can also follow along with the logs with `tkn taskrun logs`:

```bash
tkn taskrun logs build-spring-api-with-buildpacks -f
```

Once complete, you'll see your newly created container image up in Docker Hub! Note that there was never a Dockerfile created or any other set of instructions on how to build this container. Instead, Cloud Native Buildpacks take a look at your code and determine what it needs in terms of runtime, dependencies, etc. 

## Keep Learning

This guide was a bit longer than most, but lays the groundwork for much of what makes up Tekton. There's still more to learn, however. The best place to keep learning is by reading the [official documentation](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline#-tekton-pipelines). There's also some great [examples](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/tree/master/examples) for those looking to get some hands-on learning.
