The worst time to start creating your strategy for backup and restore is after you need it, so knowing the tools and methods available to you and developing a robust solution early can save you a lot of grief in the future. Even the best Kubernetes deployments can see unexpected events that would otherwise leave you without your production environment. A solid backup and restore plan also has the advantage of giving you a method to migrate workloads from one environment to another.
