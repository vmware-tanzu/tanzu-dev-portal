Agile software development is a set of methods that result in fast and frequent delivery of value to your customers. It promotes well-planned, small iterations by highly collaborative, cross-functional teams. Agile methodologies provide an alternative to the sequential development and long release cycles traditionally associated with Waterfall.

Many agile teams work in a co-located environment, which helps foster healthy team dynamics. The shift to remote working brings a host of new challenges. We’re all aware that remote working in some form is here to stay. Although the benefits for organizations are huge, we must also recognize and address the challenges remote working brings—to mental well-being, collaboration and productivity.
