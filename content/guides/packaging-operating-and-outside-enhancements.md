Sometimes breaking down your monolithic application into smaller services is too large of a task, but that doesn't mean that there's not certain advantages to be had elsewhere. Changes to how you package and operate your application can increase performance and give you better insight into your code. Additionally, while a large restructure of your code may not be possible, depending on your language and framework there may be additional improvements to be had.
