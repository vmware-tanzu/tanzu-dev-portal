This list is a starting place for considerations about the Kubernetes platform
running your applications. It is not exhaustive and should be expanded based on
your requirements.

### Required

{{% checklist-item title="etcd is highly available" %}}
It is important to configure etcd with high availability to minimize the risk of
data loss. Ensure a minimum of three nodes are running and are placed in
different fault domains.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="etcd cluster is healthy" %}}
Ensure the members of your etcd cluster are healthy. The below commands give you
a glimpse of the status of your cluster.

Note the need to substitute the node IP's for x, y and z below:

```
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key member list

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key --endpoints=https://x:2379,https://y:2379,https://z:2379 endpoint health
https://x:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 9.969618ms
https://y:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 10.675474ms
https://z:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 13.338815ms
```

{{% checklist-item title="A Backup/restore strategy is outlined" %}}
Each cluster is different. Think through and understand what elements of your
cluster need to be backed up and restored in the event of single or multi-node
failure, database corruption or other problems. Consider the applications
running in the platform, the roles and role bindings, persistent storage
volumes, ingress configuration, security and network policies, etc.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="A certificate renewal process is in place" %}}
All certificates in the cluster have an expiration date. Although it is likely
the cluster will be upgraded/replaced before then, it is still recommended to
have a process to refresh/renew them documented.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Failure domain/availability zones have been considered" %}}
In both cloud and on-premise installations, the importance of using different
availability zones/failure domains for your control plane nodes is fundamental
to cluster resiliency. Unless there is an architectural redundancy in your
topology (mirror clusters per AZ, or globally load balanced clusters) consider
control plane node location.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Ingress

{{% checklist-item title="Load balancer is redundant" %}}
Your ingress should be configured to run on several pre-defined nodes for
high availability. Configure the load balancer to route traffic to these nodes
accordingly. Test to make sure all defined nodes are getting traffic.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Load balancer throughput meets requirements" %}}
Testing your cluster for network bottlenecks before going live is a must. Test
your load balancer and ingress throughput capacity to set realistic expectations
from the results obtained.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Network / CNI

{{% checklist-item title="Pod to Pod communication works" %}}
Validate that Pods can communicate with other Pods and that the Services
exposing those Pods correctly route traffic.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Egress communication has been tested" %}}
Validate that Pods can reach endpoints outside of the cluster.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="DNS functionality validated" %}}
Test that containers in the platform can resolve external and internal domains.
Test internal domains with and without `.cluster.local` prefix.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Network Policy configuration validated" %}}
When applicable, validate that network policies are being enforced as expected.

More information on designing a network policy for your cluster can be found in
the
[Network Policy Implementation](../container-networking-network-policy)
library document.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Capacity

{{% checklist-item title="Nodes can be added seamlessly" %}}
The worker node deployment and bootstrap process should be defined and
automated. Ensure new nodes can be seamlessly added to the cluster enabling and
preparing it for growth.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Cluster autoscaling enabled" %}}
Cluster autoscaling automatically adjusts the size of the cluster when
insufficient resources are available to run new Pods or nodes have been
underutilized for an extended period of time. When applicable, verify it is
enabled and the expected actions are taken under these conditions.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="ResourceQuotas are defined" %}}
[ResourceQuotas](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/)
provide constraints that limit aggregate consumption of resources per namespace.
They limit the quantity of resources of a given type that can be created. Define
and implement them in the relevant namespaces.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="LimitRanges are defined" %}}
[LimitRanges](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/#enabling-limit-range)
define default, minimum and maximum memory, CPU and storage utilization per Pod
in a namespace. These should be defined to avoid running unbounded containers.

You can find more information about this in the
[resource limits](../workload-tenancy-cluster-tuning#resource-limits)
section of the cluster tuning library document.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Monitoring

{{% checklist-item title="Platform is monitored" %}}
The API, controllers, etcd, and worker node health status should be monitored.
Ensure notifications are correctly delivered, and a dead man's switch is
configured and working.

The Tanzu Labs library contains a
[thorough monitoring checklist](../observability-k8s-monitoring-checklist/)
to help you plan your tests accordingly and ensure full coverage.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Containers are monitored" %}}
The containers running on the platform should be monitored for performance and
availability. Kubernetes provides liveness and readiness checks, and prometheus
can give you more in-depth information of application performance. Review the
[probing application state](../app-enhancements-probing-app-state/)
guide content for details.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Storage

{{% checklist-item title="Test storage classes" %}}
Ensure defined storage classes are working as expected. Test them by creating
persistent volume claims to ensure they work as defined. Validate the claims
bind properly and have the expected write permissions.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Upgrades

{{% checklist-item title="Define and test the upgrade process" %}}
Document, automate and test the upgrade process to ensure it is consistent and
repeatable.

This will help determine the upgrade expected downtime and availability impact
to properly set expectations with application owners.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Identity

{{% checklist-item title="Configure an identity provider" %}}
Verify that the configured identity provider is functional. Test the platform
login process using existing and new users.

See the [identity and access control](../identity) section of the
library for more details.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

{{% checklist-item title="Define user groups and roles" %}}
Ensure roles and role bindings have been correctly applied to the groups
created.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Metrics

{{% checklist-item title="Validate metric collection" %}}
Verify that the metrics aggregation pipeline for the workloads and the platform
is functional. This is a requirement for cluster and pod autoscalers to work.

The
[Platform Monitoring Guide](../app-observability-exporting-metrics/)
goes deep detailing monitoring, alerting and visualizing the metrics collected
by the system.
{{% /checklist-item %}}

### Logging

{{% checklist-item title="Validate log aggregation and forwarding" %}}
Verify the container and platform logs are reaching their destination. These can
be stored within the cluster or forwarded to an external system.
