What do you do if you lose state in your cluster, or something went very wrong
and you need to revert it or move my resources to another cluster? Are you out
of luck?

That’s where [Velero](https://velero.io/) comes in. Velero is an open source
tool to safely backup and restore, perform disaster recovery, and migrate
Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. This guide will show you
how to deploy Velero to your Kubernetes cluster, create backups, and recover
from a backup after something goes wrong in the cluster.

{{< youtube id="VBwBR9Em_1A" class="youtube-video-shortcode" >}}
## Prerequisites

Before you get started you will need to do the following:

* **Create a Kubernetes cluster**: You need a Kubernetes cluster, v1.10 or
  later, with DNS and container networking enabled. This guide uses a Google
  Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Linux cluster with Kubernetes version 1.16.5 and
  Velero 1.5.3. As of the writing of this guide, Velero
  [does not officially support Windows](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/basic-install/#velero-on-windows).
* **Install
  [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) on our
  local machine**: You probably already have this one if you're working with
  Kubernetes.
* **Verify the cluster has a
  [storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)**:
  Check if you have a storage class with `kubectl get storageclasses`. You need
  one to create persistent volumes.
* **Install the `velero` CLI**: There are a few
  [options](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/basic-install/#install-the-cli) to
  install Velero. This guide uses `brew install velero` and `velero` v1.5.3 .
  [Enabling shell autocompletion](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/customize-installation/#enabling-shell-autocompletion)
  can be very helpful too.

You can also look at the [Velero Basic Install documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/basic-install/).

## Setup

Now that you have your Kubernetes cluster and the Velero CLI installed, we can
move to the next step.

First you need to **install Velero server components** in your cluster. To do
this, you need a **storage provider** for Velero to store your resources and
volumes. In this guide, since we use GKE, we will use Google Cloud Storage as
the object store. If you're deploying Velero in a different environment, check
the [providers documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/supported-providers/)
for specific setup instructions.

You can either use the `velero install` CLI command with the required storage
provider flags or the
[Velero Helm chart](https://vmware-tanzu.github.io/helm-charts/). We will use
the CLI in this guide.

### Initial Setup

There are quite a few different storage provider options such as [vSphere](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/a-deep-dive-into-the-kubernetes-vsphere-csi-driver-with-tkgi-and-tkg), AWS,
and GCP. This guide uses the
[setup for GCP](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#setup).

{{% aside title="Note for GKE Users" %}}
If you run Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), make sure that your current IAM
user is a cluster-admin. This role is required to create RBAC objects. See
the
[GKE documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control#iam-rolebinding-bootstrap)
for more information.
{{% /aside %}}

1.  First we need to create an object storage bucket for Velero to save backups in:
    ```
    BUCKET=<your-bucket-name>
    gsutil mb gs://$BUCKET/
    ```

    With GCP you can set Velero permissions
    [using a service account](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#option-2-set-permissions-with-using-workload-identity-optional)
    or optionally
    [using Workload Identity](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-gcp#option-2-set-permissions-with-using-workload-identity-optional)
    to set up Velero GCP permissions. This guide will use a service account.

2. Get the current GCP project:
    ```bash
    PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
    echo $PROJECT_ID
    ```

3. Create a service account for Velero:
    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts create velero \
        --display-name "Velero service account"
    ```
    Tip: If you'll be using Velero to back up multiple clusters with multiple
    GCS buckets, you may want to create a unique name per cluster instead of
    just `velero`.

4. Set `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` to the email attached to your new service account:
    ```bash
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
    --filter="displayName:Velero service account" \
    --format 'value(email)')
    ```

5. Attach the IAM policies Velero needs to interact with the object store bucket:
    ```bash
    ROLE_PERMISSIONS=(
        compute.disks.get
        compute.disks.create
        compute.disks.createSnapshot
        compute.snapshots.get
        compute.snapshots.create
        compute.snapshots.useReadOnly
        compute.snapshots.delete
        compute.zones.get
    )

    # Create an IAM role, Velero Server, with the above role permissions
    gcloud iam roles create velero.server \
        --project $PROJECT_ID \
        --title "Velero Server" \
        --permissions "$(IFS=","; echo "${ROLE_PERMISSIONS[*]}")"

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
        --member serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
        --role projects/$PROJECT_ID/roles/velero.server

    gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL:objectAdmin gs://${BUCKET}
    ```

6. Create a service account key. The following command will store it locally in a file called `credentials-velero`.
    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create credentials-velero \
        --iam-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
    ```

### Install Velero

OK, now it’s time to install Velero. We need to give `velero install` the
provider, provider plugin, storage bucket, and IAM credentials.

```bash
velero install \
    --provider gcp \
    --plugins velero/velero-plugin-for-gcp:v1.1.0 \
    --bucket $BUCKET \
    --secret-file ./credentials-velero
```

It will then display the resources that are being created. If you’re interested
in looking further, you can view Velero's server-side components by running:

```bash
kubectl -n velero get all
```

Velero also uses a number of CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) to represents
its own resources like backups, backups schedules, etc.

## Run Apps

As an example, we will deploy an instance of Ghost. Ghost is a personal blog,
similar to WordPress. We will be using the
[Ghost Helm Chart](https://bitnami.com/stack/ghost/helm).

1. Create a file containing configuration values for the Ghost Helm Chart. Ghost
   uses MariaDB for storage. For simplicity, we are going to hard-code in that
   file the database credentials, as well as the login credentials (so that we
   know these passwords). The `ghostPassword` and `ghostEmail` will be used to
   log into the admin account to create blogs. 
   
   {{% aside type="warning" title="Caution" %}}
   These are sample, insecure passwords. Please don’t use these outside of
   a demo! Instead of a values YAML file, we could also use multiple `--set`
   flags when invoking `helm install` below.
   {{% /aside %}}
   
    ```bash
    # Create a file called ghost-values.yaml in the current dir
    # And add the following variables
    # ghostPassword has a minimum of 10 characters

    cat <<EOF > ghost-values.yaml
    ghostUsername: admin
    ghostPassword: "0123456789"
    ghostEmail: admin@example.com

    mariadb:
        auth:
            rootPassword: "root_password"
            password: "db_password"
    EOF
    ```

2. Add the `bitnami` repository of Helm charts.
    ```bash
    helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    ```

3. Create the `ghost` namespace and install the Helm chart.

    For Helm 3:

    {{% aside title="Tip for Helm 3.2.0 and later" %}}
As of Helm 3.2.0 you can add a `--create-namespace` flag to the `helm`
command instead of using kubectl to create the namespace first.
    {{% /aside %}}

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace ghost

    helm install ghost bitnami/ghost -n ghost \
        --version 12.1.0 \
        --values ./ghost-values.yaml 
    ```

    You should see an error message telling you that you "did not provide an
    external host"; so we're going to address that.

4. Check if the load balancer is up and running. It should have an `EXTERNAL_IP` listed.
    ```bash
    # The -w flag is for watching changes. You need to do ctrl-c to exit.
    kubectl -n ghost get svc -w
    ```
    You should see a service for `ghost` (the app)  and `ghost-mariadb` (the database).
    ```
    kubectl -n ghost get svc

    NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
    ghost           LoadBalancer   10.108.8.228   35.233.219.60   80:31603/TCP   2m2s
    ghost-mariadb   ClusterIP      10.108.8.42    <none>          3306/TCP       2m2s
    ```

5. Once it’s running, get the load balancer’s external IP and add it to our
   ghost-values.yaml and upgrade the Helm chart to get the deployment to start:
    ```bash
    # Set the APP_HOST to the ghost service's EXTERNAL-IP. You could also copy-paste
    export APP_HOST=$(kubectl get svc --namespace ghost ghost \--template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ . }}{{ end }}")

    # Add ghostHost to ghost-values.yaml
    echo "ghostHost: $APP_HOST" >> ghost-values.yaml
    # Check the file to see it got added and isn't blank
    cat ghost-values.yaml

    # To complete the Ghost deployment, we will run upgrade with the ghostHost
    helm upgrade ghost bitnami/ghost -n ghost \
        --version 12.1.0 \
        --values ./ghost-values.yaml
    ```

6. Helm will show us our blog URL, and the admin URL that we will use in a
   minute to create some content. The IP address is the `EXTERNAL_IP` of the
   load balancer.

    So right now you should be seeing these resources. Your IP addresses will be
    different; and if the pods are not both `Running` and `READY` yet, give them
    a minute to come up.

    ```bash
    kubectl -n ghost get all

    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/ghost-86b56c9d44-gk2f8   1/1     Running   0          44m
    pod/ghost-mariadb-0          1/1     Running   0          50m

    NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
    service/ghost           LoadBalancer   10.108.8.228   35.233.219.60   80:31603/TCP   50m
    service/ghost-mariadb   ClusterIP      10.108.8.42    <none>          3306/TCP       50m

    NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deployment.apps/ghost   1/1     1            1           44m

    NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
    replicaset.apps/ghost-86b56c9d44   1         1         1       44m

    NAME                             READY   AGE
    statefulset.apps/ghost-mariadb   1/1     50m
    ```

7. Now open your `Admin URL` in a web browser. If it doesn't load, double-check
   that the pods shown in the previous section show up as `1/1` in the `READY`
   column. Sign in the admin interface with the email and password that we
   entered earlier in the values file. You should now see the following screen,
   which will let us create a blog:
   ![Ghost Admin Page](/images/guides/kubernetes/velero-gs/1-welcome-to-ghost.png)

   Click on the `+` next to Posts to create your first post. Enter a title and
   some content, then click Publish in the top right.
   ![Ghost Publish Page](/images/guides/kubernetes/velero-gs/2-ghost-create-post.png)

   The home page should now look like this:
   ![Ghost Page With Post](/images/guides/kubernetes/velero-gs/3-ghost-home-page.png)

## Backup

Now, let’s look into backups in case something happens to the blog. Backups are
for Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. You can back up your entire
cluster, or optionally choose a namespace or label selector to back up.

They can be run one off or scheduled. It’s a good idea to have scheduled backups
so you are certain you have a recent backup to easily fall back to. You can also
create [backup hooks](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/backup-hooks/) if you want to
execute actions before or after a backup is made.

By default, the backup retention is 30 days, but you can change it with the `--ttl` flag.


1. [Optional] To see what all you can do with backups run:
    ```bash
    velero backup -h
    ```
2. Let’s start with the most basic option: creating a one off backup. It’s a
   good idea to give it a meaningful name so you remember what it was for unlike
   what is done here.
    ```bash
    BACKUP=gastly
    velero backup create $BACKUP --include-namespaces ghost
    ```

    If we wanted to do a backup with all namespaces we can remove the
    `--include-namespaces` flag. And to include all namespaces except specific
    ones we could use `--exclude-namespaces` with the namespace(s) we don't
    want.


3. Let’s create a backup from a schedule. 
    ```bash
    SCHEDULE=minute
    velero schedule create $SCHEDULE --schedule="@every 1m" --include-namespaces ghost
    # You could also use schedule="*/1 * * * *"

    velero backup create minute --from-schedule $SCHEDULE
    ```

4. See all of the backups created:
    ```bash
    velero backup get

    NAME                    STATUS            ERRORS   WARNINGS   CREATED                         EXPIRES   STORAGE LOCATION   SELECTOR
    gastly                  Completed         0        0          2021-01-28 00:19:44 -0800 PST   29d       default            <none>
    minute-20210128081949   Completed         0        0          2021-01-28 00:19:49 -0800 PST   29d       default            <none>
    minute-20210128081849   Completed         0        0          2021-01-28 00:18:49 -0800 PST   29d       default            <none>
    …
    ```

5. [Optional] For both curiosity and debugging, it’s useful to do a `describe`
   and `logs` on your backups:
    ```bash
    velero backup describe $BACKUP

    velero backup logs $BACKUP
    ```

## 🔥Wreak Havoc🔥

Now that we have a happy cluster state and that most excellent blog you
created...let’s nuke Ghost.

Let’s say that _**someone**_ (you) “accidentally” (definitely intentionally)
deleted the Ghost Helm chart and the persistent volume claim (PVC) by running
the following:
```bash
helm delete --namespace ghost ghost
kubectl -n ghost delete pvc data-ghost-mariadb-0
```
Try to connect to Ghost again. Shoot... Now the blog site is down and so is that
_**super important**_ blog post you just made. What now?

## Restore

Well, it’s a good thing you have backups! Now it's time to look into restoring
from a backup.

1. To see what all you can do with restore run:
    ```bash
    velero restore -h
    ```
    
2. Let’s now wait for all of the resources to be gone. First check the output of
   `get all`:
    ```bash
    kubectl -n ghost get all
    ```
    And the Ghost and MariaDB persistent volumes claims (PVCs) as well:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pvc
    ```
    Note: It might take a minute until everything is properly deleted; so you
    may run these commands above until they give you a (somewhat ominous)
    `No resources found` output.

2. Now to perform a restore:
   
   To take a look at what backups you have you can run the following again:
    ```bash
    velero backup get
    ```
   To restore from the specific backup we created first:
    ```bash
    velero restore create --include-namespaces ghost --from-backup $BACKUP
    ```

3. So the big questions are:
   * Did all the resources come back up and therefore the Ghost site?
   * Is the _super important_ blog back, or only the default blogs?

   * Let’s find out. First let’s check to see if our resources are back and
     running.
    ```bash
    kubectl -n ghost get all

    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    pod/ghost-86b56c9d44-gk2f8   1/1     Running   0          2m13s
    pod/ghost-mariadb-0          1/1     Running   0          2m13s

    NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
    service/ghost           LoadBalancer   10.108.14.225   34.105.103.109   80:30353/TCP   2m12s
    service/ghost-mariadb   ClusterIP      10.108.5.14     <none>           3306/TCP       2m12s

    NAME                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deployment.apps/ghost   1/1     1            1           2m12s

    NAME                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
    replicaset.apps/ghost-86b56c9d44   1         1         1       2m12s

    NAME                             READY   AGE
    statefulset.apps/ghost-mariadb   1/1     2m12s
    ```

    Again, wait until all the pods above are `Running` with counts of `1/1` pods
    in `READY` state.

4. Now get the `EXTERNAL_IP` from your service:
    ```bash
    kubectl get svc --namespace ghost ghost --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{ . }}{{ end }}"
    ```

    {{% aside type="warning" title="Double check your IP" %}}
Note: Your IP address may have changed from earlier. For the depth of this
specific demo it doesn't cause problems. However, to ensure all links work
properly, update the `ghostHost` in `ghost-values.yaml` and run the
[previous `helm upgrade`](#run-apps) command again. If we were using
[`external-dns`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) and
hostnames, it would automatically resolve itself.
    {{% /aside %}}

    Now head to you the IP address in your browser and your blog should be up
    with the post you wrote!

5. [Optional] For both curiosity and debugging, it’s useful to do a `describe`
   and `logs` on your restores:
    ```bash
    velero restore describe <restore-name>

    velero restore logs <restore-name>
    ```

As of Velero 1.5 [Restore Hooks](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/restore-hooks/) are
also available.

For cluster migration (restoring from one cluster’s backup into another cluster)
you can follow the
[cluster migration documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/migration-case/).

## Cleanup

To delete the app resources, you can use `helm uninstall` and then delete the
namespace:
```bash
helm uninstall --namespace ghost ghost
kubectl delete ns ghost
```

If you would like to remove Velero from your cluster, you can use:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace/velero clusterrolebinding/velero
kubectl delete crds -l component=velero
```

Now, if you'd like to remove the GCP resources that we created earlier:
```bash
# Remove the velero service account
gcloud iam service-accounts delete $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL

# Delete the velero role
gcloud iam roles delete velero.server --project $PROJECT_ID
# We don't need to delete the key or the policy binding, as they get removed automatically.

# Finally, remove the storage bucket.
gsutil -m rm -r gs://$BUCKET
```
