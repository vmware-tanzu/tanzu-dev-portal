[Carvel](https://carvel.dev/)[^1] is an open source suite of tools. Carvel provides a set of reliable, single-purpose, composable tools that aid in your application building, configuration, and deployment to Kubernetes.

It currently[^2] contains the following tools:
* **[ytt](https://carvel.dev/ytt/)**: Template and overlay Kubernetes configuration via YAML structures, not text documents. No more counting spaces, or manual quoting.
* **[kbld](https://carvel.dev/kbld/)**: Build or reference container images in Kubernetes configuration in an immutable way.
* **[kapp](https://carvel.dev/kapp/)**: Install, upgrade, and delete multiple Kubernetes resources as one "application". Be confident your application is fully reconciled.
* **[imgpkg](https://carvel.dev/imgpkg/)**: Bundle and relocate application configuration (with images) via Docker registries. Be assured app contents are immutable.
* **[kapp-controller](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller)**: Capture application deployment workflow declaratively via App CRD. Reliable GitOps experience powered by kapp.
* **[vendir](https://carvel.dev/vendir/)**: Declaratively state what files should be in a directory.
