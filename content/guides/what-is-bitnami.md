Bitnami is an application packaging and publishing startup that was acquired by VMware in 2019. It is a leading provider of prepackaged open source software that runs natively in environments where a large portion of developers and other users want to build or deploy applications in the major public clouds, on laptops, and on Kubernetes. 


## Why should I use Bitnami? 

With more than a decade of experience publishing an extensive library of open source applications and app building blocks, Bitnami is well-known for keeping all its software up-to-date with the latest application versions, dependencies, and operating systems. Every application is prepackaged to work out of the box, with no need to finish configuration or setup on your own. Every Bitnami app is packaged with best practices, run through extensive automated tests, and certified to be up-to-date and working in its target platform. 

Bitnami simplifies the management of multi-cloud, cross-platform environments by providing functionally equivalent, platform-optimized application and infrastructure stacks for each of them instead of abstracting differences away. This enables a degree of standardization across platforms while allowing in-depth integration with vendor-specific features and services. 

Most importantly, **all the Bitnami solutions are free to use and open source**.


## Where can I find Bitnami apps? 

The Bitnami catalog is exclusively available on the VMware Marketplace – VMware’s one-stop shop for tools and ecosystem solutions. Clicking any app in the Marketplace catalog will bring you to its individual page where you can find out how to deploy a solution as a virtual machine or as a [container](https://tanzu.vmware.com/containers).  

For public clouds, browse the [Bitnami Application Catalog](https://bitnami.com/stacks) and deploy cloud images onto [Google Cloud](https://google.bitnami.com/), [AWS](https://aws.bitnami.com/), or [Azure](https://azure.bitnami.com/) using Bitnami launchpads. You can also access Bitnami containers from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/bitnami), [AWS ECR Public](https://gallery.ecr.aws/?searchTerm=bitnami), and helm charts from the Bitnami chart repository. 


## Check out Bitnami docs and community sites 

Each Bitnami app has extensive documentation that makes it easy to get started. Check out [Bitnami Documentation](https://docs.bitnami.com/) for more information. 

In addition to great content across many different marketplaces, Bitnami also has a large community of more than 1.5 million developers! On the [Bitnami Community](https://community.bitnami.com/) page, Bitnami engineers, maintainers and fellow developers help each other when they run into trouble, share ideas on how to use Bitnami stacks, and discuss topics like open source software.
