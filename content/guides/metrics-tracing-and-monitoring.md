Metrics, monitoring, and tracing are all valuable pieces in diagnosing issues in your applications. Being able to know exactly what happens, when it happens and why it happens are all questions that need answered before you can even begin debugging an issue. Even better, a properly instrumented application emitting metrics means problems can be caught before they're ever seen by your users.
