description: Python apps go great with containers. Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry,
  Public Cloud, Private Cloud, they're all awesome places to run your containers.
  But getting your apps into containers is a tricky business, particularly if you
  have tens or hundreds of apps to manage, and maintain. Your containers have to be
  secure, reproducible, and easy to rebuild when vulnerabilities strike or upgrades
  are required. Enter Cloud Native Buildpacks, the brand-new (yet 10-year-old) technology
  developed by industry legends like Heroku, Google, and Cloud Foundry. With buildpacks,
  your Python apps are automatically built into secure, toughened containers that
  you can run anywhere and update anytime (including locally on your computer). All
  without a single line of Dockerfile!
