description: As a developer, you love your Dockerfiles! You love them because you can easily specify all the layers of your application's container and control exactly what you build into your image. But you still had to figure out how to actually run your container on Kubernetes, and that's busy work you can probably do without, right? That's where the Tanzu Application Platform comes in. It can take your Dockerfile, build your container, and run it on Kubernetes for you - no YAML required!
