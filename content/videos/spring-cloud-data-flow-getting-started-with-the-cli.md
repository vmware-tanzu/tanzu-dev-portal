description: We get it. You like Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes (https://dataflow.spring.io/),
  but you also like to ‘flow’. You know every IDE keyboard shortcut. To others, your
  terminal screen looks like something out of The Matrix. GUI dashboards make you
  wince. Not a problem. Spring Cloud Data Flow includes a fully-featured command-line
  interface that you can use to keep your browser tab-count low and your productivity
  high. Let Ben Wilcock (@benbravo73) show you where to find the Spring Cloud Data
  Flow Shell and how to get started using it.
