description: We get it. You like Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes (https://dataflow.spring.io/),
  but you also like to ‘flow’. You know every IDE keyboard shortcut. To others, your
  terminal screen looks like something out of The Matrix. GUI dashboards make you

  interface that you can use to keep your browser tab-count low and your productivity
  high. Let Ben Wilcock (@benbravo73) show you where to find the Spring Cloud Data
  Flow Shell and how to get started using it.
