description: Did you know? It takes less than 5 minutes to create your first data
  source in Spring Cloud Data Flow for Kubernetes (https://dataflow.spring.io/) Let
  Ben Wilcock (@benbravo73) guide you through the code and deployment steps in less
  time than it takes to grab a coffee from the kitchen. Ben uses Spring Cloud Stream,
  RabbitMQ, Docker, and Spring Boot to create a containerized source of fictitious
  Bank Loan Applications. It takes two shakes of a Lamb’s tail (about 5 minutes).
