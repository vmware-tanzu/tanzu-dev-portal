Many developers use Node.js to build scalable network applications, leveraging its asynchronous, event-driven JavaScript runtime. In order to respond to REST requests from remote Web apps, the Node.js apps often need access to information kept in a datastore.

Using VMware Tanzu GemFire for storing and accessing data can dramatically improve both the performance and resilience of your Node.js apps. Tanzu GemFire is an in-memory, NoSQL, key-value distributed datastore powered by Apache Geode. It delivers high-concurrency, low-latency data access for your applications while also maintaining internal data consistency."
