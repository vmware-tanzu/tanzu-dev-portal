Utilizing the auto-configuration of Spring Boot with Tanzu GemFire/Apache Geode.  The [Spring Boot for Apache Geode documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/reference/html5/) further discusses the details of many of these topics.

## Version Compatibility
The best way to determine the correct version of Spring Boot for Apache Geode for your project, is to use [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/).

After selecting your project settings, click on 'Add Dependencies'. Search for 'Geode' and add it to your project. Then select either ‘Generate’ which create a zip file to import into your IDE or ‘Explore’ which will open a build file based on your Project selection (Maven or Gradle)

You can also refer to the [Spring Boot for Apache Geode compatibility matrix](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/wiki/Spring-Boot-for-Apache-Geode-and-Pivotal-GemFire-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#version-compatibility-matrix).
