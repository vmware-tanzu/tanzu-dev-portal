This Node.js example demonstrates the basic authentication and authorization mechanism used when an app interacts with a Tanzu GemFire cluster. The app does a put, a get, and a remove operation to show authorization.

This example works with either a local Tanzu GemFire cluster or a local Apache Geode cluster.
