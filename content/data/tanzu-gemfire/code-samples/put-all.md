This Node.js example provides a simple JavaScript application that demonstrates basic `putAll` and `getAll` operations on VMware GemFire cluster. This application leverages the CRUD-ops example, which you should review prior starting. This example client works with either a local Apache Geode cluster or with a VMware GemFire cluster.
