type: samples

---

This is a sample that uses `client.properties` file along with `client.xml` file. This approach applies the client properties from a file instead of hard coding them into your code. It's a simple command line program that connects to a region using a cache factory object and does not involve any dependency on Java. Please refer to [the docs](https://gemfire-native-dotnet.docs.pivotal.io/101/geode-native-client-dotnet/connection-pools/configuring-pools-attributes-example.html) for more details.  

This sample was created, built and tested with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.
