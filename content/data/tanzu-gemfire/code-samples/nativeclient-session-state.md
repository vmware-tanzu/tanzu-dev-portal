This is a sample code that stores a session state for an ASP.NET app (basically .NET Web App). It's a command line simple program that connects to a region using cache factory object and does not involve any dependency on Java.

Before you continue, you need to follow these steps for `SessionStateProvider` sample works:

- In your Web.Config file, add below section under <system.web> section. The timeout value can be changed as needed:
 ```xml
    <!--GemFire SessionStateProvider-->
<sessionState mode="Custom" cookieless="false" timeout="20" customProvider="GemFireSessionProvider">
  <providers>
    <add name="GemFireSessionProvider" type="Pivotal.GemFire.Session.SessionStateStore" region="sessionStateRegion"/>
  </providers>
</sessionState>
 ```

- In `Global.asax.cs` code-behind file, you will need add a class called `BasicAuthInitialize` that implements the `Apache.Geode.Client.IAuthInitialize` interface. It can also be declared outside of the `Global.asax.cs` file, in its own class file (for example: `BasicAuthInitialize.cs`).

 ```java
 public class BasicAuthInitialize : IAuthInitialize
{
    private string _username;
    private string _password;
    
    public BasicAuthInitialize(string username, string password)
    {
        _username = username;
        _password = password;
    }
    
    public void Close()
    {
    }
    
    public Properties<string, object> GetCredentials(Properties<string, string> props, string server)
    {
        var credentials = new Properties<string, object>();
        credentials.Insert("security-username", _username);
        credentials.Insert("security-password", _password);
        return credentials;
    }
}
 ```
Please refer to the docs for more details: https://gemfire-native-dotnet.docs.pivotal.io/102/gemfire-native-client-ssp/ssp.html.

- In `Global.asax.cs` file and under `Application_Start()` event, add the line that initializes the instance of `BasicAuthInitializeClass` class using its constructor that accepts the credentials.
- Make sure you have `geode.properties` and `cache.xml` files defined that contain the necessary information to connect to the GemFire cluster and client side properties. Please refer to [this doc](https://gemfire-native-dotnet.docs.pivotal.io/102/geode-native-client-dotnet/configuring/system-level-configuration.html) and [this article](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/How-to-configure-geode-properties-file-for-GemFire-NET-Native-Client-10-2-with-an-ASP-NET-application?language=en_US) for more details.
