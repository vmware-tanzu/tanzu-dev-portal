Spring Developers have evolved from the 00s, where being an experts in XML was a critical to your very survival. In the 2010/20s - JSON and YAML are king. Typically, a full stack Spring Developer will need to manage multiple config file formats; application.yml, Kubernetes manifest, Terraform ,Ansible, Cloud Formation the list goes on. Jsonnet is a data templating language developed at Google that is very similar to their internal GCL (Generic/Google Config Language). Jsonnet allows common data fragments such as IP addresses and host names to be shared across multiple configuration files regardless of format. It has powerful data merging that allows config snippets to be "mixed in" to different files. We will walk through an example of how a Spring project can benefit from DRY configuration using Jsonnet.
