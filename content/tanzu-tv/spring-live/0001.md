The Kubernetes ecosystem can be very operator focussed and it can be a challenge for developers to distill the information that is relevant for their job. There are a large number of available tools aimed at solving a broad set of problems but it can be daunting choosing which to invest in. This session aims to suggest best practices and get hands-on with some of the essential tooling.
