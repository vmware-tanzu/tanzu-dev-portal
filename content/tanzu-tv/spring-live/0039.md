Many teams question how to best manage mobile application complexity across multiple
platforms, and this has led to the creation of many tools to try to simplify it. Unfortunately, these tools can add more complexity and overhead than they remove! Instead of trying to abstract away the differences between mobile and web platforms, this talk explores how to share business logic amongst them with minimal tool dependencies by using C/C++, JavaScript, and Kotlin.
