This talk will explore the latest release of Spring Batch as well as how to utilize it in a modern kubernetes environment. We will work through building a cloud-native batch process using Spring's stack including Spring Batch, Spring Cloud Task, and other cloud tools as well as dive into what makes developing batch processes on kubernetes both attractive as well as easy!
