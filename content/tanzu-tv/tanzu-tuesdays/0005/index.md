Rather than a set of slides, this will be a live mob programming exercise where we will develop several helm charts from scratch to deploy to a fresh kubernetes cluster. By the end of the session we’ll not only have learned how to write a helm chart, but also how to upload and share them via a chart repository and will explore other tools in the ecosystem as time permits.
