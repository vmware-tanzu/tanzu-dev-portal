The Java ecosystem provides a variety of libraries and standards to help you define and launch batch processes: [Java EE batch processing](https://www.baeldung.com/java-ee-7-batch-processing), [Quartz Job Scheduler](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/), [Cron Utils](https://github.com/jmrozanec/cron-utils), [Easy Batch](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-batch) ... 

If you are only using Spring, there are many ways to easily schedule and run batch jobs. 

For simple, scheduled activity tightly coupled to the app itself [Spring Scheduler](https://spring.io/guides/gs/scheduling-tasks/), provides the simplest solution to set up a method for performing periodic work.

If a job requires more control, or is going to benefit from having its own atomic deployable unit, we look to [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch) and [Spring Cloud Task](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-task) (SCT) to work at a higher level of abstraction. Both work great with [Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-dataflow) (SCDF). As we gradually move towards a higher level of abstraction, we're going to introduce multiple batch jobs that require oversight and orchestration. 

Refer to Spring Cloud Task's [Getting Started](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-task/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#getting-started) guide for details on how to manage multiple jobs as part of an application; and to become familiar with Task and SCDF so that you can join the discussion within your project.
