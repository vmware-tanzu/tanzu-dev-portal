title: Service Discovery and Client Load Balancing
weight: 120
layout: single

In this lab we will enable our applications to use
[service discovery](https://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/2-0/common/service-registry/)
to register and locate microservices. The applications will be using
Internal Routes on TAS.

At the end of the lab, each application will be able to discover
microservices by name, reducing the configuration needed to deploy our
system.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing the lab, you will be able to:

-   Describe the pros and cons of using Service Discovery
-   Describe the pros and cons of using Client Side Load Balancing
-   Explain how to add Client Side Load Balancing and Service Discovery
    to an application
-   Identify the differences between routing through the Gorouter and
    container to container networking

## Get started

1.  Check out the
    [Concepts](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14P89lCFrS5Jcql1HA1lxrspMUGKnsc8R1VOQWcMUPLs/present#slide=id.ge9ceda5589_0_0)
    slides.

1.  You must have completed (or fast-forwarded to) the
    [Deploy a Distributed Application lab](../deploy-distributed-system/).
    You must have your `pal-tracker` application associated with the
    `deploy-distributed-app-solution` codebase deployed and running on TAS.

1.  In a terminal window,
    make sure you start in the `~/workspace/pal-tracker` directory.

You will make no code changes in the lab.
You will make only configuration changes to your
distributed app running on TAS.

## Service discovery and client load balancing

Take a look at the following to view pattern and components:

-   Service Registry and Discovery solution pattern:

-   Load balancing in a modern cloud application:

## Use Internal Routes instead of Spring Cloud Services Registry

1.  Make sure your work is saved and committed to Github.

1.  Configure network policies for your consuming applications
    `tracker-allocations`, `tracker-backlog`, `tracker-timesheets` to
    talk to `tracker-registration`:

    ```bash
    cf add-network-policy tracker-allocations --destination-app tracker-registration
    cf add-network-policy tracker-backlog --destination-app tracker-registration
    cf add-network-policy tracker-timesheets --destination-app tracker-registration
    ```

1.  Find out the internal route domain for your foundation:

    ```bash
    cf domains
    ```

    look for the domain of the entry marked "Internal".

1.  Create an internal route for the `tracker-registration` application
    using the unique identifier for the host name you used in this lab,
    as well as the internal domain you found in the previous step:

    ```bash
    cf map-route tracker-registration ${INTERNAL_DOMAIN} --hostname=registration-pal-${UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER}
    ```

1.  Set the registration server endpoint configuration to point to the
    internal route:

    ```bash
    cf set-env tracker-allocations REGISTRATION_SERVER_ENDPOINT http://registration-pal-${UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER}.${INTERNAL_DOMAIN}:8080
    cf set-env tracker-backlog REGISTRATION_SERVER_ENDPOINT http://registration-pal-${UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER}.${INTERNAL_DOMAIN}:8080
    cf set-env tracker-timesheets REGISTRATION_SERVER_ENDPOINT http://registration-pal-${UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER}.${INTERNAL_DOMAIN}:8080
    ```

1.  Restart the consuming applications to pick up the new route:

    ```bash
    cf restart tracker-allocations
    cf restart tracker-backlog
    cf restart tracker-timesheets
    ```

1.  Run through the curl commands to verify the container-to-container
    integration works.
