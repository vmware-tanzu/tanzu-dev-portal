<div>
 <p>Hi, Spring fans! In this installment, Josh Long (@starbuxman) talks to his friend Chris Richardson (@crichardson), who helped articulate and advance cloud computing, reactive programming, microservices, domain-driven design, event sourcing, and so much more years before the zeitgeist. Also, we used to work together! </p><iframe title="Thought leader Chris Richardson (and no, I?m not using that title ironically!)

 <p>Want to meet more amazing people in our ecosystem, like Chris? SpringOne 2022 is almost here! I feel like it?s that anxious, exciting time before, sort of important holiday where you get given gifts! And with it, Spring Boot 3 and Spring Framework 6. We?re going to be announcing everything right here on the Spring blog, of course, but if you want a chance to learn from the source, then I hope you?ll join us 6-8 December 2022, right here in my hometown of San Francisco, my favorite west coast city in the USA, and my hometown. (Psst.: If you register now, there?s a $200 discount from the pass price with this code <code>S1VM22_Advocate_200</code>.)</p>
