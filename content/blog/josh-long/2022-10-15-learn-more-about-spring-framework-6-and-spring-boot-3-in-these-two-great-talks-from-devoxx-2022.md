title: 'Learn more about Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 in these two great talks from Devoxx 2022'
---

<div>
 <p>Hi, Spring fans! I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. </p>
 <p>I could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, <a href="https://twitter.com/snicoll">St?phane Nicoll (@snicoll)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bclozel">Brian Clozel (@bclozel)</a>, who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying <em>huge</em> new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. </p>
 <p>This first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FWNpaiqYhw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>This second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.</p>

 <p>NB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. </p>
 <p>Enjoy! </p>
