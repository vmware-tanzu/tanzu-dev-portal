title: 'Spring Tips: the road to Spring Framework 6: the new Ahead-of-Time Compilation Engine and GraalVM'
---

<div>
 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Spring Boot 3 is here (or will be tomorrow, on the <strong>24th of November, 2022</strong>, to be more precise!), bringing a fantastic new Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation engine that supports GraalVM native images. Join me, and we?ll dive deep into the engine and its interactions with the Spring component model. </p>
 <p>This video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about. </p>
 <p>Enjoy! </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOfYlLjXufw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>Also, Happy thanksgiving (if you celebrate) from us to you!</p>
