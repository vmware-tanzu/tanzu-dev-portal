 <p>Hi, Spring fans! It?s Tuesday, the 22nd of November, 2022, as I write this, which means we?re two days away from Spring Boot 3 <em>and</em> Thanksgiving. Spring Boot 3, I?ve written about in abundance so I won?t rehash that. If you want to learn more about some of the amazing new features in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, perhaps check out my Spring Tips installment introducing them in this episode:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aUm5WZjh8RA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>And, of course, a major new feature in Spring Boot 3 is the new ahead-of-time (AOT) engine, about which I speak at great length in tomorrow?s new installment of Spring Tips:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOfYlLjXufw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 <p>This video is done so that you can watch the first part as an application developer and get a lot out of it. Folks who want to take the concepts further - as a library, or framework, or developer, can carry on ?till the end of the video. Either way, I hope you learn something interesting in your journey to production with Spring Boot 3, due - again - in less than 48 hours? time!</p>
 <p>I mentioned Thanksgiving. The US isn?t the only country to have such a holiday, so I?m perhaps telling some folks things they already know, for which I?m sorry, but: Thanksgiving is a (self-explanatory) holiday in which people are encouraged to be <em>thankful</em>. To take stock in our lives and find reasons for gratitude. My friends, I am grateful for you. I?m sure I speak for the entire Spring team (celebrating Thanksgiving or not!) when I say that we are <em>all</em> thankful for you. Happy Thanksgiving, my friends.</p>
 <p>Without further ado, let?s dive right into this week?s epic roundup.</p>
