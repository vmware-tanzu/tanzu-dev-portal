 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! I?ve been busy this last week! I?ve been visiting with customers and talking to the community here in South East Asia. I was in Malaysia last week, and now I?m in Bangkok, Thailand. I?m near the end of my time here in SE Asia, which makes me sad. I?m dearly going to miss the food and the weather, but time waits for no person, and it?s almost time to go home.</p>
 <p>And with time comes a jam-packed roster of new things we can read and learn from. So, without further ado, let?s dive right into it!</p>
