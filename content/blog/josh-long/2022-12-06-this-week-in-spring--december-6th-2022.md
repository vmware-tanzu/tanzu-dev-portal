 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! How are you? You know what I?ve wanted to do? See my friends on the Spring team in person since the pandemic descended. And, I?m overjoyed to relate, I?ve just had the privilege of a nice meeting with several of them last night. And I?m going to see more of them today! Seriously. I feel like I won the lottery. I?ve missed my friends. Hug your friends and family, friends. You never know when the next pandemic (or life in general) will put distance between you and them. So, in order to close that distance, I?m going to go back to meetings with them, and I?ll leave you with yet another week?s curated list of content. (Can you believe we?re like four weeks away from 2023?)</p>
