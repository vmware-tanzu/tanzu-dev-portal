 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Happy new year! It?s <strong>2023</strong> already! Who saw that comin?? I sure didn?t. This year promises to be more amazing than ever, and I can?t wait to be a part of it.</p>
 <p>As usual, the first week of January is when we mark the date of the first installment of this humble roundup, <em>This Week in Spring</em>, <em>waaaay</em> back in the first week of January 2011! <em>12 years</em> of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! Now <em>that?s</em> consistency! </p>
 <p>And it?s only possible because of you, dear community. <em>Thank you</em>. You, who have been consistently excellent every week of the year for years and years, are truly the reason for the <em>season</em>, and we appreciate you. This week is no exception! There?s a ton of great content, so let?s kick the year off right!</p>
 <ul>
  <li>First, I?ll be speaking at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/atlantajug/events/290659991/">Atlanta JUG</a> on the 16th of this month, by the by, so please join me, and we?ll dive headfirst into Spring in 2023!</li>
  <li>Last week, I had the pleasure of interviewing my friend, and teammate, the legendary <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/12/29/a-bootiful-podcast-dashaun-carter-amazing-human-being-father-friend-engineer-and-fellow-spring-developer-advocate">DaShaun Carter</a> on a <a href="https://bootifulpodcast.fm"><em>Bootiful Podcast</em></a></li>
  <li>I <em>love</em> this post by Rafael Winterhalter (create of ByteBuddy and <a href="https://bootifulpodcast.fm/#/episodes/c106105d-fc05-4321-ad4b-5b7b18e0e722"><em>Bootiful Podcast</em> guest</a> on the amazing publish/subscribe capabilities of PostgreSQL. I love PostgreSQL. But then he goes even further, turning the mechanism into support in Spring Integration. He explains everything in this epic post, <a href="https://www.javaadvent.com/2022/12/using-postgres-as-a-message-queue.html"><em>Using Postgres as a Message Queue</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://joshlong.com/jl/blogpost/create-an-empty-git-branch.html">Create a new Git branch with no history</a> - not strictly speaking Spring-related, but I thought it was interesting. Unless you?re not using Git? I suppose.</li>
