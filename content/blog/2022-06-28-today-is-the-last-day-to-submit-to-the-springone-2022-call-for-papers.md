title: 'Today is the last day to submit to the SpringOne 2022 Call For Papers!'
---

<div>
 <p>Hi, Spring fans! This year, <strong>SpringOne</strong> is <em>back</em> in person, and being held in my hometown of San Francisco, California, December 6th-8th. (<a href="https://springone.io/">Have you registered?</a>) and today (June 28th, 2022) is the <em>last day</em> to submit to the Call For Papers! If you have a good idea or story you want to share, <a href="https://springone.io/2022/cfp"><strong>submit today</strong></a>!</p>
 <p>Either way, I hope to see you in December in San Francisco, a city so famous for its foggy nightscapes that I think it?s fair to say we are <em>the original cloud natives</em>! </p>
