 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! This week’s all sorts of weird for me. It’s <em>Tuesday</em>! But here in the US we just celebrated the 4th of July, and I, like many Americans, took a long weekend. Took some time with the family to do a little road trip up north to visit Mt. Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a <em>lot</em> of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom! </p>
