Come to the VMware booth during expo hours October 26–28, 2022, to try out some short workshops using open source software! We have workshops for everyone. Engineers will be at the booth to help and to answer any questions you might have. No laptop needed; just bring yourself!

If you’re unable to come to KubeCon in person, don’t worry; you can do these workshops from the [virtual booth](https://via.vmw.com/kubecon-workshops) as well.

 **Each workshop you do will give you another chance to win a Millennium Falcon Lego set!**

For the virtual booth, there will be one winner for the week. For the booth workshops, we will contact one winner each day!

Our beginner and advanced workshops will help you learn a number of cloud native tools.

## New to containers and Kubernetes?
Are you new to containers or Kubernetes? We have workshops just for you: a **Container Basics** workshop and a **Kubernetes Fundamentals** workshop!

## Carvel
New to the [Carvel](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/carvel/) tool suite? We have an **Introduction to the Carvel Tools** workshop and a couple of other tool-specific workshops! Carvel provides a set of reliable, single-purpose, composable tools that aid in your application building, configuration, and deployment to Kubernetes.

Writing lots of YAML can be pretty tedious, especially when you’re reusing a lot of the same or similar lines. That’s where [ytt](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/ytt-gs/), a tool in the Carvel suite, comes in. You can use it for templating your YAML. Learn about it with the **Introduction to ytt Templates** workshop.

Lastly, we have a workshop on using [**kapp-controller**](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/kapp-controller-gs/) to install application packages. Kapp-controller provides a flexible way to fetch, template, and deploy applications to Kubernetes. It also helps keep apps continuously up to date when the configuration in a source repository changes.

## Cartographer
We also have a workshop to get you started with [**Cartographer**](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0087/), which is a [supply chain choreographer for Kubernetes](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/supply-chain-choreography/). Cartographer is great for pulling together multiple unrelated Kubernetes add-ons into a cohesive path to production. We previously mentioned ytt, which lets you use templating for YAML (i.e., it makes your life easier). Well, Cartographer lets you use templating for your supply chains too. This lets platform admins expose the options developers want. Our workshop shows how you can turn source code into a running app with just 10 lines of YAML.

## kpack
[Kpack](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/cnb-gs-kpack/) makes it so you don’t need to worry about creating a Dockerfile. It uses Cloud Native Buildpacks to build container images from your code. Best of all, your builds can run from a powerful Kubernetes cluster instead of using up CPU on your laptop. Check it out with our **Building Images with kpack** workshop.

## Knative
New to serverless or, specifically, Knative? Check out our workshop on **Knative**. Knative (Serving) simplifies deploying microservices on Kubernetes. With a single command, you can build services based on your containerized applications without having to learn or build various Kubernetes objects. Knative automates the back-end objects needed to run microservices on top of Kubernetes. To learn more about Knative Serving, check out this [video](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/enlightning/6/) and [guide](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/knative-serving-wi/). To learn about Knative Eventing, check out [this video](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/enlightning/7/).

## Spring + Kubernetes
Are you interested in [Spring](https://spring.io/) and Java? 

We have a workshop for **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) on Kubernetes**. Spring Boot makes it easy to create standalone, production-grade, Spring-based applications that you can “just run.”

If you want to learn more about Spring, come join us at [SpringOne](https://springone.io/) December 6–8, 2022, in San Francisco.

We are so excited to see you all at KubeCon North America 2022. We hope these workshops will help you and your teammates learn the skills to solve problems in your own workflows. Best of luck in the raffle drawings!
