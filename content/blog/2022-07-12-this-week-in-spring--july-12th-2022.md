 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! How are you? This week I?m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we?re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It?s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven?t seen since before the pandemic! I?ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It?s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.</p>
 <p>We?ve got a lot to cover this week so let?s dive right into it!</p>
 <ul>
  <li>In last week?s podcast, I talked to <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/07/07/a-bootiful-podcast-kubernetes-contributor-and-fellow-tanzu-developer-advocate-leigh-capili">Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili</a></li>

  <li>I put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Basl?, showing how to handle pagination with the <code>expand</code> operator in Project Reactor: <a href="https://joshlong.com/jl/blogpost/pagination_in_a_reactive_application.html">Pagination in a Reactive Application</a>. It looks at how to eleganrly <em>expand</em> the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.</li>
