title: 'Price Reduction - Azure Spring Apps does more, costs less!'
---

<div>
 <p>We believe in providing the most innovative cloud offerings at incredibly competitive prices. As we operate Azure Spring Apps, we continue to build efficiencies and economies of scale. We are passing those efficiencies to you. </p>
 <p>Many customers have asked us to lower the size of the base unit to make it easier to get started and accommodate smaller projects. </p>
 <h2><a href="#announcing-price-and-base-unit-reduction" class="anchor" name="announcing-price-and-base-unit-reduction"></a>Announcing Price and Base Unit Reduction</h2>
 <p>Effective September 1st, we are reducing the base unit of Azure Spring Apps Standard and Enterprise to 6 vCPUs and 12 GB of Memory. And reducing the overage prices for vCPU and Memory. </p>

 <h2><a href="#new-monthly-free-grants" class="anchor" name="new-monthly-free-grants"></a>New Monthly FREE Grants</h2>
 <p>Furthermore, to help you get started, effective mid-September, we are offering monthly FREE grants ? 50 vCPU hours and 100 Memory GB hours. </p>
 <p>Let?s look at a few examples: </p>
 <p>Note: If you are running 10 app instances with 1 vCPU and 2GB in Azure Spring Apps Standard, the service will consume 50 vCPU hours (10 app instances x 1 vCPU x 5 hours) and 100 Memory GB hours (10 app instances x 2 GB x 5 hours) in 5 hours. After that, the base and overage prices will be charged. Please note that the base unit in Standard tier allocates 6 vCPUs and 12 GB of Memory and it runs for 8 hours and 20 minutes using the monthly free grant. </p>

 <p>In 2019, Microsoft and VMware announced Azure Spring Apps, a fully managed service for Spring applications. Since then we?ve helped many customers adopt the service including <a href="https://aka.ms/Bosch.IO">Bosch</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/DLR">Digital Realty</a>, <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/71ed338e-5f85-44d8-a225-6210fdbdd06d?source=sessions">FedEx</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfgiW6xJseM">Kroger</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/Liantis">Liantis</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wdwjqXTFFZ0">Morgan Stanley</a>, <a href="https://aka.ms/secure-com">National Life</a>, <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1388620728739667057-raleys-uses-azure-spring-cloud-to-optimize-scale-and-drive-innovation">Raley?s</a>, and <a href="https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1358540087031302788-swiss-re-accelerates-java-app-modernization-using-azure-spring-cloud">SwissRe</a>. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Apps that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.</p>
 <p>We set out to solve many of the common challenges enterprise developers face when running Spring applications at scale. We have continued to collaborate to expand the core service to become the Azure Spring Apps of today with a broader set of features, including the recently announced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-spring-apps-enterprise-tier-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/3418245">Azure Spring Apps Enterprise</a>.</p>
 <p>We will continue to deliver on our commitment to provide the best value to you.</p>
