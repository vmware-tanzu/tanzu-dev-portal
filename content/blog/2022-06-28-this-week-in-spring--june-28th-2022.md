title: 'This Week in Spring - June 28th, 2022'

<div>
 <p>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of <em>This Week in Spring</em>! I’m writing this from the Big Apple, New York City! I’m here for the SpringOne Tour 2022 NYC event. This is my first time back in New York City since before the pandemic and it has been <em>so</em> much fun. I’ve been catching up with people I’ve not seen in <em>years</em>. I even accidentally bumped into people I had no idea was going to also be in town at the same time as I was. New York City is like a magnet for fun, and for fun people. Anyway, we’ve got a lot of stuff to get to this roundup, so let’s dive right into it. </p>
 <p>Also: if you’re just reading this, today - the 28th of June - is the <em>last</em> day to submit to SpringOne 2022, being held in my hometown of San Francisco, California, in December of this year! </p>
