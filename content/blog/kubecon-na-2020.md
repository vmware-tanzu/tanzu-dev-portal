[KubeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/) is coming up soon! It will take place virtually November 17th-20th.

The [schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/) is chock-full of very interesting talks,from introductory overviews to advanced deep dives. When I first saw it, I ended up copying down as many talks as possible to share here because they are all just so good. But I figured I should probably curate a bit, so below you will find a list of my top recommendations, broken down, for the most part, by their respective [Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md) names.

Talks with a üå± next to them are introductory/deep dive talks, and each SIG section header links to its respective SIG page.

### Keynotes
If you can, definitely watch all of the keynotes. There is a [complimentary pass](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/register/)  just for the keynotes if you‚Äôre unable to attend the rest of the conference.

### Sponsored
If you‚Äôre interested in seeing what cool things different companies are working on and/or are interested in, check out the sponsored sessions on [Day 1](https://kccncna20.sched.com/2020-11-17/overview/?iframe=no).
