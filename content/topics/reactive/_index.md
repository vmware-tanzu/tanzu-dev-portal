Reactive programming moves away from traditional input/output and imperative programming and to focus more on asynchronous consuming and producing streams of data. You can think of reactive programming as [event streaming](../event-streaming) but in your codebase. Streams can be filtered, combined, split, and processed on as data flow through them.
