Event streaming can be thought of as flipping the flow of requests in the opposite direction. Instead of a standard call-response cadence to communicate with each other, services simply emit an “event”—any significant change-of-state—that is open for any interested services to consume. Some frameworks like [Spring Cloud Stream](/guides/event-streaming/scs-what-is/) ease the integration with these messaging services.
