With a microservices architecture, individual teams build and run single-focused, loosely-coupled services that are independently deployable and scalable; this is in contrast to more traditional or [monolithic architectures](/guides/microservices/deconstructing-the-monolith). Developers use the language, framework, or data technologies of their choice, but microservices are typically implemented as [REST APIs](/guides/microservices/basics-of-rest) and often use a [continuous delivery](/guides/ci-cd/ci-cd-what-is) pipeline for regular production deployments.
