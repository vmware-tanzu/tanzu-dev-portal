Deciding on what your Kubernetes platform looks like can take a lot of decisions. If your workloads are straightforward, you could keep your platform basic and use a few existing solutions out there for things like container networking and deployment. For a more complex architecture, maybe you want to use a full-fledged all-in-one solution. Either way, a solid understanding of Kubernetes and its architecture will help you makes these decisions.
