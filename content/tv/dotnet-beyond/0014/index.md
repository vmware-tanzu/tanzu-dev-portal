With constantly emerging attack vectors, evolving security standards, inherent complexity in implementation libraries, and lack of general security expertise, it's no wonder teams are scratching their heads when trying to secure their microservices. With API gateways becoming a common pattern to consolidate API surface, there's a golden opportunity to offload some of the security complexity into a centralized place. This session will look at how Microsoft's new .NET library called Yet Another Reverse Proxy (YARP) can be used to secure applications in a variety of scenarios.

Attendees will learn how to use YARP to create a uniform API surface for their apps, apply different security strategies, integrate with Federated Identity providers with OpenID Connect, and bridge line-of-business application security requirements with those of the greater organization.
