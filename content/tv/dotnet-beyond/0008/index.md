No matter the industry, applications need to talk to each other. So, developers often build bridges—Application Programming Interfaces (API)—to allow one system to communicate to another.

Over time, different API architectural styles have been released. Each of them has its own characteristics, patterns of data exchange, pros and cons. REST, GraphQL, and gRPC are three main options when it comes to API development and implementation. In this session, Poornima will cover what REST, GraphQL, and gRPC are from a .NET perspective and give you a comprehensive comparison between them.
