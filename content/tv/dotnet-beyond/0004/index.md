People love to stay in their comfort zone; but what if you have to step outside of it and embrace a new programming language, one that happens to be ASP.NET?

Jakub is a Java/Spring developer and architect. He’s never used ASP.NET before and he has questions. Lots of questions.

Layla, a .NET developer, intends to answer Jakub’s questions and more in this demo-rich session.

But don’t worry, there will also be something for existing ASP.NET developers as we delve into the ways an ASP.NET application is configured to support services:

- Dependency injection and inversion of control
- HTTP clients and policies
- Resiliency and circuit breakers
- Databases connections
- Discovery clients
- And more!
