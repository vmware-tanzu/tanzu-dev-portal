In this talk we will look at why we might use messaging, and how we use messaging in a .NET app.

We'll start by exploring distribution and why we can think about conversations between processes being synchronous or asynchronous, and exposing functionality or exchanging data. Then we will talk about where messaging fits, and the contexts in which we might prefer it. Along the way we should get a better understanding of messaging compared to alternatives like sharing a database or HTTP/GRPC.

Then we will show an example of using messaging in a .NET app.

Finally, we will give pointers to resources for those who wish to explore this topic in greater detail, now that they have mastered the basics.
