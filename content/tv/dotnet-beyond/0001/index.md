.NET continues to evolve—but how did it get here? Join Richard Campbell on a tour of the history of .NET, Visual Studio, and the related tools that have been helping developers produce millions of applications. So many forces shape how development tools are created, and Richard ties together the story of the hardware, software, market, and political forces that have brought .NET to be an open source, cross-platform development platform. The winding path of .NET has been influenced by many things along the way, and the future looks bright!
