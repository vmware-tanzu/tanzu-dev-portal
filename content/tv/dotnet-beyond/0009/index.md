In the autumn of 2018, we were faced with an application that wasn't performing and was very hard to change. Deployment was hit and miss almost every time.

We did the thing that you're warned against (for good reason!) and started from scratch.

This is our journey on taking that application from technical concept to production: how we included the experience of our team in our initial decisions, the things we learnt as the code was evolving, and during performance testing. And what our plans are for the future to make it even betterâ€”and raise our team at the same time!
