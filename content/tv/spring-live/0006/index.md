While Kotlin is the alternative JVM language of choice for Android applications, on the server side it can be used everywhere Java can. The Spring Framework in particular makes excellent use of Kotlin features. Spring supports Kotlin data classes, takes advantage of reified types, and provides small domain-specific languages for bean configuration, testing, and more. This talk will show how Kotlin fits into the Spring ecosystem and how Spring developers can benefit from its null safety, strong typing, and powerful support for concurrency.
