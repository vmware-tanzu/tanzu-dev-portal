A large part of embracing DevOps involves embracing automation. Over the last decade we have seen the emergence of “as Code” — Build-as-Code, Configuration-as-Code and Infrastructure-as-Code. The benefits to utilizing such tools are huge! We can codify the state of the world around our applications, giving us the ability to treat everything that our code needs like we treat the code itself. Version control, release management, tagging, even rolling backs are now possible. Terraform, an open-source tool from HashiCorp allows us to build, control and modify our infrastructure. Terraform exposes a Domain-specific language (DSL) that we can use to express what our infrastructure should look like. Terraform can work with all the major cloud providers, including Amazon AWS, Google GCP and Microsoft Azure. If you are curious about what this tool has to offer, this session is for you. Come on in, and let's learn how to Terraform your cloud.

This session will focus on Terraform. We will look in to how this tool works, explore its capabilities, and see how it can play a pivotal role in our Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) strategy. With lots of code and demos, this session will certainly give you enough fodder for thought, and provide a baseline so you can decide if Terraform is right for you.
