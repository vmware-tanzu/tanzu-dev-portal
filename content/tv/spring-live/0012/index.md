Bring us your sick and needy! This is your chance to get a health check or vital signs on your application written with Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Or maybe you have a success story you'd like to share with others? Or just come and chew the fat, and maybe a problem shared will be a problem halved. Dave will answer as many questions as he can and queue up the others until we can find the right person to ask. No problem is out of bounds, but if you are interested in resource usage in modern apps and platforms, startup time, or performance measurements and improvements, this is a great opportunity to learn and contribute.
