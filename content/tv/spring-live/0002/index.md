According to recent studies, Spring Boot is the most widely used Java framework today, with
over 75 million downloads per month and counting. Most Java developers are familiar with
Spring Boot and the benefits it brings to enterprise development in general, but they are often
less acquainted with its cloud native progeny, Spring Cloud. This talk serves as a hands-on,
beginner’s introduction to Spring Cloud, including a practical demonstration of some of its
latest modules. It features the live development of a simple cloud native application, built in
real time while showcasing various distributed computing patterns and integrating with Consul
and Resilience4J. In the ever-evolving world of modern, cloud native architectures, learn why
Spring Cloud is still an essential tool that every Java developer should know.
