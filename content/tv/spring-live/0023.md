In Spring Framework 5.0, we introduced WebFlux.fn: a functional way to define reactive web endpoints. In Spring 5.2, we added WebMvc.fn, which does the same for nonreactive, Servlet environments. In this talk, we'll discuss both WebFlux.fn and the new WebMvc.fn and cover topics such as: * the difference between annotation-based MVC and this functional approach, * using router and handler functions, * request predicates, * nested routes, * and more!
