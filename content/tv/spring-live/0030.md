Many of us have a great deal of experience working with traditional relational databases and with so-called NoSQL databases (document stores & key/value pairs) as well. Graph databases provide capabilities that we may not have fully leveraged…yet. In this session, learn how to exploit the power of connected data quickly and powerfully using Spring Boot and Spring Data. The presenter will explain the types of data that benefit most from a graph database and demonstrate how to really use Spring to take advantage of it. We will also take a look at the new reactive capabilities and how this can take your application to the next level. Learn how to elevate the relationships among your data to the same level as your data and tap the full power of the stack!
