A quick tour of building a Spring Boot application to handle incoming CloudEvents. This app will be deployed on Kubernetes using Knative Serving and Eventing. We'll start from scratch using https://start.spring.io and step by step build up and deploy our app to a Kubernetes cluster. In the process we'll use Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Function, CloudEvents SDK for Java and Knative in addition to general Kubernetes tools like kubectl and skaffold.
