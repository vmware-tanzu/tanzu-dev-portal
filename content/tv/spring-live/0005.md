Hosting an app with Kubernetes is the path of least resistance, we don't need to understand how a given infrastructure/Cloud works. Kubernetes abstracts and automates all that for us. Kubernetes has native objects that can help deploy, scale, configure and Load balance applications. These objects can be specified in text files along with a call to the Kubernetes API. However, we do need to learn what these objects are and how they can help us define application requirements. In this session we will take a look at Kubernetes, its objects and walkthrough a workflow of deploying and managing a Spring boot app with Kubernetes.
