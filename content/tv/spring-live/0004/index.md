Machine Learning is clearly here to stay. While it is a far cry from actual Artificial Intelligence, it provides many invaluable and remarkable ways to learn from the data we are collecting about our customers, products and daily activities. The past afforded us machine learning libraries which became machine learning frameworks. Now, we are designing and building machine learning platforms that facilitate entire initiatives in reusable and extensible ways. We will discuss many of the drivers of modern machine learning systems and the platforms that we are seeing emerge.
