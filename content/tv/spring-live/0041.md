Along with a quick getting started experience, Spring Boot includes a number of additional features to help you monitor and manage your application when you push it to production. Spring Boot's Actuator provides a powerful set of features that can be used with HTTP or JMX to help you monitor and manage your application. Externalized configuration and profiles help you run your application with a different set of properties based on the environment. Additionally, Spring Boot provides support for Micrometer, an application metrics facade that supports numerous monitoring systems. In this talk, we will look at some of the features that you can use in your Spring Boot application when deploying it to production.
