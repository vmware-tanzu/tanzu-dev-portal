Encouraging other people to participate in your companyâ€™s open source project is not an easy task, and there is no one size fits all solution. However, there are some things that you can do to increase your chances of success.

This talk contains 3 parts, and here are a few examples of what will be covered in each section:
-Openness and Transparency: Use public channels for all project communications, and include decision-making processes and leadership in your governance documents. Be honest with yourselves and the community about governance and contributions.
-Growth: Remove barriers to contribution and consider how legal decisions will impact participation. Be proactive, but leave space for outside contributors.
-Corporate Factors: Provide training for engineers and product managers in how to work and plan features in the open. Recruit customers and partners as contributors. 

You will walk away with practical advice about encouraging outside participation in corporate open source projects.
