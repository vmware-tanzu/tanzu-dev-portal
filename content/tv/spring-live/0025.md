We’ve seen a growth in the use of cloud-native architectures, particularly microservices. Microservice-based architectures help improve scalability and velocity but implementing them can pose challenges. For many Java developers, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud have helped address these challenges, providing a robust platform with well-established patterns for developing and operating microservice applications. But creating and maintaining a Spring Cloud environment requires work. Such as setting up the infrastructure for dynamic scaling, installing and managing multiple components, and wiring up the application to your logging infrastructure. In this session, the speaker will introduce how to easily bring Spring boot microservices to the cloud with Azure Spring Cloud, a fully managed service built and operated by Microsoft and Pivotal, troubleshoot them and scale them.
