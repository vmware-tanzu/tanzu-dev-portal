We launched the Tanzu Platform to enable our development teams. Platform and DevOps automation ensures software launches and patching are delivered consistently, securely, with scalability and zero downtime. This allows our customers to realize cost efficiencies and recognize revenue sooner than previously possible. Using this platform we wee able to quickly launch two programs that met our customer demands while being able to make updates to the site on demand and scale to manage orders for a new vehicle being launched.
