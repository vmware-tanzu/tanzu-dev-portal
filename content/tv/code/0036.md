In this session, we’re going to explore some new possibilities for native Spring Boot applications with Spring Native and GraalVM. we’ll look at using the Exposed ORM for Kotlin; Spring Integration; and the Okta Spring Boot starter. It’ll be fun. And we might even explore some of the new bits in Spring Integration 5.5, while we’re at it.
