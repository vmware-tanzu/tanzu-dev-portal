Developing applications with Spring Boot is already a pretty magical experience, but could it be better? Can the magic get any more powerful than it already is? Since Spring Framework 5.0 became generally available in 2017, Kotlin has enjoyed full first class support as a language for developing Spring applications.

As such, you can use Kotlin anywhere you would use Java: migrating to it gradually or all at once, running Spring apps in production with any mix of Java & Kotlin code - including in the same microservice! For Java developers, Kotlin feels like a natural addition to their spell book. But as with any new endeavor, the first step is often the most difficult to take. In this talk, weâ€™ll look at how Kotlin can be used to reduce boilerplate, increase code quality, and elevate your code wizardry.

The presenter will demonstrate how to begin incorporating Kotlin into your existing Spring applications and, once you start your journey, where it can lead. Come to this session to level up on Spring+Kotlin! (Robes optional)
