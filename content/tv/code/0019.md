In this Live-Coding Adventureâ„¢, Mark explores and explains security concepts like user authentication and authorization and demonstrates how to secure a Spring Boot application using Spring Security.

Included in this session are both blocking and non-blocking, reactive mechanisms for securing all the APIs and evaluation of when a forms-based approach is a good solution, when it is not, and what alternatives exist (alternatives to be covered in a future session). Come join the fun!
