Over the years, I have written a few real-time streaming apps, but haven’t written many Batch jobs. Join me as I explore the world of Spring Batch and find out how more Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable it is over any ordinary scheduled task or eventually consistent stream. To make things even more fun, I’ll give it a go by deploying jobs to Spring Cloud Dataflow, whilst using my favorite language of the last couple of years – Kotlin!
