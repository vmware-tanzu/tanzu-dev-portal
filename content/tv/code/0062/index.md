In this episode, we will cover the new features in Spring Boot 2.6. We will go through the release notes and discuss the new features by looking at some code. Each new release is broken down into 2 sections, upgrading from a previous version and new features. At a high level this is what I would like to cover:

- Upgrading from Spring Boot 2.5
  - Release Versioning
  - Deprecation
  - Circular References
  - Path Matching Strategy
  - Actuator Env
  - Application Startup
  - Records & Configuration Properties
- New & Noteworthy
  - SameSite Cookie Attribute
  - Reactive Server Session Properties
  - Pluggable Sanitization Rules
  - Java Runtime Information
  - Build Info Property Exclusion
  - Health Support
  - Metrics Support
  - Docker Image Building Support
  - `WebTestClient` for Spring MVC
