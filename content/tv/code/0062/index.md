  - Circular References
  - Path Matching Strategy
  - Actuator Env
  - Application Startup (2.4)
  - Records & Configuration Properties

  - Pluggable Sanitization Rules
  - Java Runtime Information
  - Build Info Property Exclusion
  - Health Support
  - Metrics Support

If we have any time left we will take a look at what's coming in Spring Boot 3.0:
