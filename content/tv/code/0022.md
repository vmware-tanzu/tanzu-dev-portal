You may (or may not) have heard of RSocket, the flexible and resilient way to crank up microservice scalability. This session offers a quick introduction, but that isnâ€™t its primary mission; rather, this is an hour-long (more or less) meandering in which Mark explores various scenarios with Spring Boot, Reactor, and RSocket to see what combinations might work, what might not, and where an edge or two may lie. Success is not guaranteed, come join the fun! All examples will be coded live & in real-time.
