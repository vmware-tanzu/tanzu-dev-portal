Nearly every app needs a database. Two of the most popular databases in the world are open source, and free to use. After 22 years in the industry, VMware knows everything about running databases in mission-critical environments and in the cloud. Now, we blend that expertise with our leadership in Kubernetes to bring you Tanzu SQL. We make it easy for Operators to set up a database service which provides cost-efficient and flexible deployments on-demand, automates time-consuming administration tasks, and satisfies enterprise requirements â€” on any cloud, anywhere.
