We are living in an era of distributed systems and microservices. Therefore, today it is essential to build your system to be scalable, resilient, performant, and straightforward. But can we solve all these problems with just a single tool? In this talk, Oleh Dokuka will show you how RSocket as a network protocol solves the most non-trivial resilience, performance, and stability problems in distributed systems.  Learn how to solve issues such as backpressure, rate-limiting, and much more.
