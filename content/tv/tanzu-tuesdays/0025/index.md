It's day 2. The corporate k8s cluster is humming. Everything works perfectly in a local environment, but how do you connect the wires? Your first few steps in Kubernetes may feel like walking through uncharted territory. Yet, several tools can make you just as productive as you were in your comfortable local setup. With only a few changes in your configuration, you can automatically rebuild clusters when a file changes and even debug software running in containers. Add this to some visualization tools and some templating software, and you'll be back on track very quickly. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use some open source tooling available around the Kubernetes ecosystem to become more productive and optimize for developer joy.
