With the quantity and types of data that must be processed in real time by enterprises today, we may be asking ourselves, "How do we create solutions to process this data and how do we orchestrate these solutions?" This discussion shows how Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) can continuously deploy, scale, monitor, and manage your stream and batch workloads by using the capabilities
on Kubernetes. 

This session walks you through the tooling capabilities of SCDF. In addition to the core orchestration features, you will also see a demo of creating a real-time streaming pipeline on Kubernetes, using recipes such as functional composition of the applications, and managing workloads. You will also see a demo on scheduling and continuously deploying batch workloads on Kubernetes, creating a single-step batch job with no coding, and distributing batch job processing across multiple machines.
