This workshop is aimed at people that are new to Kubernetes and want to quickly level up their experience and learn the basics of Kubernetes in a few short hours.

This will be a hands-on-keyboards workshop where each participant will have access to a Kubernetes cluster and will follow along running each command and deploying applications into Kubernetes. By the end of the workshop, you'll have the confidence and knowledge to deploy workloads into Kubernetes.

* A Kubernetes cluster (minikube or kind are ok)
