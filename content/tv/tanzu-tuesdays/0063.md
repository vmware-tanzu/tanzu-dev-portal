The latest release of Steeltoe version 3.1.0 introduces two major features: Steeltoe Messaging and Steeltoe Stream. .NET developers targeting event driven architectures will find these features invaluable. Steeltoe Messaging provides high-level abstractions for sending and receiving messages. Steeltoe Stream is a framework for building event-driven microservices connected via shared messaging systems. With support for Spring Cloud Data Flow, the Steeltoe framework makes it very easy to build and orchestrate data processing applications that use both .NET and Java stream based components together. In addition to these major features, this release adds numerous enhancements especially in the area of configuration management including new configuration providers and a bootstrapping feature that greatly simplifies configuring Steeltoe applications.  

This session will dive into these concepts:
Overview of the Steeltoe project, Message driven architectures and their challenges, Steeltoe Messaging abstractions, Steeltoe Stream framework, Support for Spring Cloud Data Flow and Interoperability between .NET and Java.
