Tanzu Community Edition is VMware's new open-source cloud native Kubernetes platform. 
It is a full-featured, easy to manage Kubernetes platform for learners and users on your 
local workstation or your favorite cloud. Tanzu Community Edition enables the creation 
of application platforms: infrastructure, tooling, and services providing location to 
run applications and enable positive developer experiences. But can it run Doom?? In 
this talk, we'll demonstrate deploying an application platform using Tanzu Community 
Edition and get it to run the classic ID Software game from 1993, Doom.
