More often than not Spring moves forwards by reacting to demand, but sometimes it also tries to move first into a new area, anticipating demand in the community. In both cases, though, there are usually experimental stages, sometimes for quite long periods.

This has always been the case, but the Spring team has recently created a special place for those experiments to happen, and that gives us a chance to spy on what is going on. This talk will be taking a look at some of the current experiments, as well as reviewing some older ones, successful and unsuccessful.
