What could be more fascinating than a room full of Tanzu Super Users and Cloud Operators gathered together to discuss the newest Tanzu product, Tanzu Application Platform (TAP)?  As many of you know, engineers are notorious tinkerers, whether it be programming on a Raspberry Pi, building a home gym, or building the latest master-level Lego set. Tune in to this episode of Tanzu Tuesday to hear the Vanguards - Tanzu customer super users - share their thoughts about Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) while building their current Lego set. Check in to find out what they have to say, how it will impact their current data centers, and see what they will be building! :)
