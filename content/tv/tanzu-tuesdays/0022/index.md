You may have seen it in your favorite streamers channel: A bot reminding you of an upcoming event, showing their uptime, and offering unique features to improve the experience for the viewer. Behind the scenes you might assume code watching every line of code, ready to respond to pre-programmed commands. But what happens when the channel has 1k views? 10k? 100k? All chatting and interacting, exchanging thousands of messages a second.
 
Spring Boot and Project Reactor to the rescue! This week on Tanzu Tuesday, we’ll build our very own chat bot. Started as a project inspired by episodes featuring [Josh Long](/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0001/) and [Spencer Gibb](/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0009/), you'll see how reactive programming helps tackle the massive volume of messages, how to package and deploy it to Kubernetes, [gather metrics with Prometheus and visualize them in Grafana](/guides/kubernetes/observability-prometheus-grafana-p1/).

Demo code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/reactive-bot-framework)
