How can we better collaborate on creating useful APIs? How to reduce the testing time of your application? How can the team build API backwards compatibility verification into their deployment process?

In this talk, Olga will discuss how to leverage the Consumer-Driven Contracts approach to solve these and other issues and present one of CDC implementations - Spring Cloud Contract. Olga will discuss practical use-cases and look at code examples.

Olga will also point out some of the possible issues and ways of handling them, as well as some good practices I have learned while working both as a CDC tools end-user and their developer.
