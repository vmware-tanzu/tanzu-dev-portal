Delve deeper into the dark and mysterious world of Kubernetes security! We'll look at how we can 
exploit a supply chain attack and start our journey to go deep inside the target infrastructure, 
exploit your position to hunt and collect the flags. We'll be demonstrating a CTF scenario, that 
we host at KubeCon Security Days, and hopefully learn something new and wryly amusing along the way!
