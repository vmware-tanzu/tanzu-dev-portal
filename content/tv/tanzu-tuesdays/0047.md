Join us to learn about Stargate! Stargate is a data gateway deployed between client applications and a database. It's built with extensibility as a first-class citizen and makes it easy to use a database for any application workload by adding plugin support for new APIs, data types, and access methods. After detailing the architecture and ideas behind the frameworks we will demo the creation of REST and GraphQL APIs on top of Cassandra through simple configuration. Bring back home a working sample!
