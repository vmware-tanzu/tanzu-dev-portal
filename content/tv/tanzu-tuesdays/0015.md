What's new in the world of [VMware Open Source](https://www.vmware.com/opensource.html)? Tiffany and Paul will explore (and try to run!) a number of Open Source projects that VMware is involved in, expect to see some [Contour](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour), [Harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor), maybe some [k14s](https://github.com/k14s), [Octant](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant), maybe even [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) and [Tern](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern).
