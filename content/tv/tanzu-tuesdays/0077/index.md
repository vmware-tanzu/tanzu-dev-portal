This summer the TAP team made a choice to build the Tanzu Application Platform’s GUI 
on top of the OSS project Backstage. We’ll discuss the reasons that led to that choice, 
the lessons learned along the way, as well as where we want to take OSS Backstage, 
TAP GUI, and the TAP GUI plugins moving forward.
