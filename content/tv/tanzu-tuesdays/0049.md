Join our special guests, the Tanzu Vanguards, as they discuss Containers and Monitoring. Current applications often consist of many different containerized services. This is great for portability and scaling, but how do you know when to scale up and down and how do your business transactions behave in this microservice mesh? And from a platform perspective, how do you ensure your platform can cope with the app's demands?  

In this session, you will learn which tools are currently available (example: Prometheus, Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, etc.) and which tool is suitable for which portion of the story. Learn what are the ups and downs of each tool and see from a user's perspective which features are mandatory and which are just nice to have. Finally, we also plan to take on the most difficult, challenging question currently facing the DevOps world: Where does the monitoring responsibility of a DevOps team end and what portions of the monitoring challenge are in the Platform team's realm? Please join us on 4/13 to find out!
