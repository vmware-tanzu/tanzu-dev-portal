In this session we are going to show you how to get your Spring apps up and running on Kubernetes.  This session will take you from everyoneâ€™s favorite place on the internet, start.spring.io all the way to automated deployments directly to Kubernetes.  We will cover tools, as well as best practices, that will make getting your Spring app from your dev machine to your Kubernetes (production) even faster and easier.  In addition we will spend some time showing you how to use Spring Cloud Kubernetes to build cloud native Spring apps that run on Kubernetes.  By the end of this session you will have all the knowledge you need to target Kubernetes as your production environment.
