Everyone experienced problems with the software that they run. We all want to know how to fix things quickly and reliably, in a confidence-inspiring manner. Let's be honest: "stop and start it" fixes are not an option for VMware customers which use our products in mission critical applications: emergency systems, factories, autonomous vehicles, etc.  RabbitMQ is this type of a system. Those responsible for it need to know when problems hit, preferably in advance, and they need a clear path to resolution. While RabbitMQ exposes a wealth of metrics, logs, and events, and has decent dashboards that help visualise these, we know that users only look at dashboards when there is a problem. Wouldn't it be great if RabbitMQ notified you when there is a problem in the making? How about a run book on how to fix that specific problem? Imagine if some problems could even be fixed automatically. That is the direction that we are going towards. Let us show you what we have so far.
