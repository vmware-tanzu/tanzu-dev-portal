For this Tanzu Tuesday, Flux project maintainer Stefan Prodan joins us for a demo of Flux.
Stefan will showcase how the project's high-quality tools
scale from simple use-cases to custom [GitOps](https://tanzu.vmware.com/gitops) platforms.
Come learn how Flux helps your team collaborate on apps and infrastructure.
