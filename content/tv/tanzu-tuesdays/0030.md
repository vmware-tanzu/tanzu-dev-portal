Spring Security was born in the days of server-generated HTML, when JavaScript was that annoying little brother you avoided but couldn’t keep from following you around. Now, JavaScript is all grown-up with a mortgage, a family, and a debugger. Is Spring Security still relevant in these modern times where many backends are little more than a REST API? In this talk, you’ll see why the answer is “yes”. We’ll start with an unsecured JavaScript frontend and Spring Boot backend. Step-by-step, we’ll make decisions about CORS, CSRF, and OAuth, each simplified by Spring Security. Also, you'll get a sneak peek at the experimental Spring Authorization Server!
