This session will be hands-on and doing live-coding - in order to show you how to use Spring Tools 4 to be super productive when working on Spring Boot applications. We’ll demonstrate all the additional help to create, understand, and navigate your Spring code, including super fast navigation across Spring definitions, deep understanding of your Spring code, and more. We’ll dive into the details of how information from live-running Spring Boot apps will appear directly in your source code to provide unique insights into your running application. You’ll see why Spring beans are(n’t) being created and where they are being injected (including navigation), available URL routes from running apps, and more. The live-coding will be done using a mixture of clients, ranging from Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse to Visual Studio Code, including support for up to Java 15, and useful features of the tooling to make every attendee more productive implementing applications on top of Spring Boot.
