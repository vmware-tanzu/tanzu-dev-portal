Building and maintaining production ready container images is a critical requirement for success with Kubernetes. Developers and organizations alike have put a lot of effort over the past decade into DIY solutions, whether it is working on the "perfect" Dockerfile, or automating the build as part of an existing pipeline. These home-grown solutions certainly address immediate needs. If we take a step back, however, we can see significant gaps that introduce overhead, risk and inefficiency.  Luckily, as the Kubernetes ecosystem matures, new solutions become available. We can rethink the problem at hand, set higher goals, and achieve them more easily.  In this talk, we'll explore how Cloud Native Buildpacks—and kpack in particular—can boost your image-building capabilities at scale. We'll also cover how you can easily use kpack and Knative together with Tanzu Community Edition.
