If you’re using one of the great observability tools out there, you probably already mark your data with important events that may affect it- deployments, configuration changes, etc. But what about changes Kubernetes makes on its own like autoscaling events? We’ll talk about Knative Eventing and how we can use it to automatically mark these events in your data, and some other ways you can use it to improve your Observability.
