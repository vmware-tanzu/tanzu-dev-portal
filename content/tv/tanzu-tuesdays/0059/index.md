Buildpacks are a pluggable, modular, language-agnostic tool that takes application source code and gives you an OCI (Open Container Initiative) image that you can run using Docker, Kubernetes, or your OCI Runtime of choice. Tired of writing and maintaining Dockerfiles and vetting base images? Unsure how that monitoring or security agent needs to be installed? Feeling pressure from your Security team about your images? Just want to get back to coding? Buildpacks have you covered. You write code and buildpacks take care of the rest. Don't believe it? Come check out this session, which will take you from doing things the hard way to doing them the buildpacks way.
