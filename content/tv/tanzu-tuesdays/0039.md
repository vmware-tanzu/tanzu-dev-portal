Deploying a Spring Application on K8s has become increasingly straightforward with new features in Spring Boot, such as OCI image building and micrometer metric exporting. In this talk, Ollie will demonstrate a number of tools and techniques that make deploying apps to Kubernetes as painless as possible. This will include generating manifests, setting up a local development workflow and exposing health endpoints.
