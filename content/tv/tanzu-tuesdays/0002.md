Have you ever watched [Bob Ross](https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc/) start with a blank canvas at the beginning of an episode and wondered how he ended the show with all of those happy little trees? You are not alone.

This session is a guided, live-coding tour of select Spring technologies with an eye toward production: Spring Boot, database access, Java, Kotlin, REST APIs, template engines, imperative, reactive...so many brushes to choose and use!

This session will be a guided tour of several key Spring technologies with the goal of exploring and understanding how they fit together, pros and cons, and options you have at hand to deliver robust production systems. Come to the session and bring your brushes! Letâ€™s build systems.
