Perhaps you have heard of 12-factor apps, cloud-native, or 15-factor apps. Maybe you have wondered if cloud-native was right for you. In this session we will explore how to deliver apps using this methodology on Kubernetes. We will start by explaining the 15-factors. We will also review the cloud native features that are built into Kubernetes. Then we will create a new application, for Kubernetes, and demonstrate how to make it "15 factor cloud native on Kubernetes" !
