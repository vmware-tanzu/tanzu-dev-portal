This session will be hands-on with live coding to give you an overview of the latest and greatest
in the world of testing using JUnit Jupiter (a.k.a. JUnit 5) and the Spring Framework.  The focus 
will be major new features in JUnit Jupiter 5.7 and 5.8 as well as recent enhancements to Spring's 
integration testing support.
