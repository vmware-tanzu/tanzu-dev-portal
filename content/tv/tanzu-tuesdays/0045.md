Microservice architectures simplify the individual components that comprise our applications, but they introduce new complexity in managing a high number of distributed APIs. With so many moving parts, how can you provide a simplified experience for consumers and ensure that your system is resilient and secure? Centralized gateways have been a long-standing solution for managing APIs, but microservices demand a new generation of lightweight micro-gateway applications. Spring Cloud Gateway is one such solution. It provides a simple yet flexible API to add the routing, resilience, and control you need to protect the edge layer of your applications. Built on Spring WebFlux, it also ensures an inherently non-blocking mechanism for efficiently routing and manipulating requests.  In this talk, we'll review the motivation for Spring Cloud Gateway and demonstrate a variety of features, such as weighted routing, circuit breakers, rate limiters, and more.
