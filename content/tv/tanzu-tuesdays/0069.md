Kubernetes has become a de facto standard in the cloud-native software development. Because Spring ðŸ–¤ K8s, we have added significant features that make Spring work even better in the Kubernetes environment. The GraalVM project has introduced native images that allow to run Java apps in milliseconds with minimal memory footprint. Because Spring ðŸ–¤ native images, we have our own Spring Native project that lets you run Spring Boot apps blazingly fast with low memory consumption. Regardless of how youâ€™re running your applications, production observability is a necessity to debug business problems and latency issues. Because Spring ðŸ–¤ observability, we help you add metrics to your processes with Micrometer and visualize latency thanks to distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth & Tanzu Observability. In this presentation we will show you how to do all of that with Spring & Spring Cloud.
