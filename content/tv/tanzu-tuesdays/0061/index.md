If you are securing a REST API with JWTs, chances are you either 1. use an authorization server or 2. have read countless variations on how a REST API can mint its own JWTs. Is this a good idea? If so, how should you go about doing it? In this talk, we'll start with an unsecured REST API and review the trade-offs of having it use self-signed JWTs. By the end, you'll have a better idea whether this is an option for you.
