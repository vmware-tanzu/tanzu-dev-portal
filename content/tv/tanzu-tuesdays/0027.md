In this episode, we'll discuss the latest changes in Spring Boot 2.3 and 2.4 that make your life easier when deploying your apps to Kubernetes.
In fact, those features are generally useful if you're pushing your apps to any type of platform: from packaging your app as a container image to publishing liveness/readiness probes, we'll see how you can leverage those features in a sample Spring Boot application.
Feel free to join and ask any Spring Boot-related question; if time allows it, we can even chat about the upcoming Spring Framework 5.3 features such as startup time profiling!
