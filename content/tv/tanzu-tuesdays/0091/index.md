In this free-form discussion, Robert, Scott and Myles will talk about all the places where Kubernetes and Infra availability concepts meet and interact. From availability zones, to node pools, from vSphere HA to pod disruption policy. Which availability technology to use when and where? What plays nice together, or doesnâ€™t. How does storage come into the picture? What kind of architectures and design choices do you end up with?
