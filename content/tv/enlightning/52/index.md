Kubernetes' [ValidatingAdmissionPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/) let you get many of the same policy outcomes that you can have from validating admission webhooks - but without the webhooks. It's built on a language called [Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) and it all runs within the Kubernetes API server itself. Join us as we discover and learn about this alpha feature and its future direction.
