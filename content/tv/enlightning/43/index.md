ingress-nginx is an Ingress controller for Kubernetes using [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy and load balancer.  It's not the NGINX inc controller... confusing, right?  In this session we will discuss how the ingress-nginx controller works, how it differs from the NGINX inc controller, the release process, and how you can help contribute to the project!
