Come learn about [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/), a Kubernetes sub-project that allows you to declaratively specify and manage Kubernetes clusters across many target infrastructure environments. You might be thinking, why do we need yet another way to provision clusters - isn't this a solved problem? In this episode, we'll see what makes Cluster API different from other provisioning approaches and why it may be an excellent solution for you.
