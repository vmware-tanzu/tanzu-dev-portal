[Contour](https://projectcontour.io/), a CNCF incubating project, is a high-performance ingress and load balancer solution for Kubernetes. Contour supports Kubernetes Ingress, its own HTTPProxy CRD, and also implements [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). In this session, we will discuss how Contour works, recent community-building efforts, community contributions, and why the team is excited about Gateway API.
