By now, Kubernetes has become the de-facto industry standard for container orchestration. But developing applications natively for Kubernetes can be a real pain. Developers should be able to focus on building cool stuff without having to maintain an entire cluster on their local machine. Here's where [DevSpace](https://www.devspace.sh/), an open source tool recently donated to the CNCF, comes in!

By abstracting and codifying your local development environment, DevSpace makes it a breeze to automate, share and collaborate across devs and dev teams.

Join us to find out how!
