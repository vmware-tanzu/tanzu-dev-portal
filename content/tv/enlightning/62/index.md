Many kinds of identity providers utilize different architectures and protocols existing in this world. The commonly-spread standard among cloud native applications (including Kubernetes) is now the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) authentication layer. So, what do you do with LDAP, SAML, or any other custom identity providers that are left behind?

[Dex](https://dexidp.io/) comes to the rescue as it is the one provider to rule them all! Lightweight, fast, and flexible, Dex allows you to plug in any upstream identity provider to make them OIDC-compatible and cloud native.
