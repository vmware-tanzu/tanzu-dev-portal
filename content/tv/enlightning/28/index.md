So you're excited about containers!
... and Kubernetes, and Buildpacks, and Tekton, and Istio, and -- what was that other thing? Which YAML file was that?

A rich landscape of tools means operations teams can address infrastructure needs with uniform, shareable skills. However, this wide range of options, interoperability, and configurability also creates complexity, and complexity can lead to surprising or even dangerous results!

The [Carvel](https://carvel.dev/) project gives practitioners tools to bring order to cloud native systems. Whether it’s dealing with the frustrations of patching app configurations, building container images, or deploying workloads continuously, Carvel has a special purpose tool just for that.

Jump in with Whitney and Leigh to learn how Carvel’s single-purpose, UNIX-inspired tools craft a clean developer experience for cloud native problem-solving.
