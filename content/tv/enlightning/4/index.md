How do you deploy a stateless application on Kubernetes?  What Kubernetes components are at play?
Where exactly does your application run in the cluster, and how does Kubernetes direct traffic to
it?  How do different parts of an application communicate with one another?  Join host Whitney Lee
and her guest (and mentor!) Rick Osowski as they discuss the answers to these questions and more!
