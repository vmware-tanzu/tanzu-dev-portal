Git is no longer just a version control system. Instead, Git sits squarely at the center of many modern software engineering practices, including (but not limited to) release engineering, versioning, and DevOps.

Leveraging Git means understanding how to correctly choose and utilize Git workflows that best suit your needs, adopting Git best practices that can scale, and understanding the landscape of tools that use Gitâ€”for CI/CD, Configuration-as-Code, Infrastructure-as-Code and so much more!

Watch this episode to learn all about how best to use Git. Go Git 'em!
