[Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) is a self-hosted OCI-compliant registry, and it is one of the first projects to graduate at CNCF. With it, you can store all of your container images and other OCI-compliant artifacts.

But thereâ€™s more! Cosign integration allows you to sign and verify your images which provides you with more secure environments. The security scanner can help you identify hidden vulnerabilities in your images. You can deploy Harbor in multi-tiered architecture. You can additionally implement fine-grained RBAC and boost your security and compliance to the next level. 

In this session we will explain how Harbor works, ways to deploy it, and some of the major features like replication, vulnerability scanning, and signing images.
