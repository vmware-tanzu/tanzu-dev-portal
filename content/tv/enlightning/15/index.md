You may already think of Kubernetes as a *container* orchestration platform.  With [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/), Kubernetes can become an *infrastructure* and/or *application* orchestration platform as well.  

Kubernetes is much more than a platform that runs containers. We can extend it to manage (almost) any infrastructure, or to manage applications running outside of Kubernetes, or to manage other things too. The way to do this is to use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to add custom resources, coupled with operators that will manage said resources.  We can even take a step further and create our own CRDs to enable other people in our organization to manage groups of resources. 

Watch this episode to learn how we can accomplish this and many other goals with Crossplane!
