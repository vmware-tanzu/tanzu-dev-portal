If my app is slow or isnâ€™t loading, how do I know what part of my system is broken so I can go fix it? With [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), a CNCF open source project, you can instrument your application in a vendor-agnostic way, and then analyze how your applications are doing in your backend tool of choice, whether it is Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, or others.

Join Whitney and Daniel as they go through the many different moving parts of the Open Telemetry Project and learn how you can get started adopting it in your environment!
