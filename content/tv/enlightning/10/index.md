Is Observability really just logging, metrics, and distributed tracing? Are we done? 
Mission accomplished? Can we go home for the week even if it is just Tuesday? You can often hear 
about the "Three Pillars of Observability" but having access to logs, metrics, and traces does not
necessarily mean more observable systems. In this session, you'll learn what Observability is, 
what problems the three pillars solve, what problems they generate, and how deep the rabbit hole 
goes behind them. We will explore the basics of the three pillars and what Spring has to offer to 
implement them. We will also talk about how to take your system to the next level, and what else 
you can find in Spring and related technologies to look under the hood of your running system.
