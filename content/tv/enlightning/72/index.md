[OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/) is a flexible authorization engine built for developers and designed to make it easy for them to model their application permissions and add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. Its modeling flexibility allows developers the ability to use it for various complex use-cases, whether it is to easily enable sharing, to support nested entities (documents in nested folders), or quickly enable multi-tenancy and much, much more. It offers HTTP and gRPC APIs, SDKs for multiple languages and several tools to make modeling easier.

In this session, we’ll go into why OpenFGA was built, where it fits into the authorization space, what makes it different from other authorization methods like Role-Based Access Control and some of the many use-cases that it covers. We’ll also go over some of the tools available to make modeling easier and give devs confidence that they’re not introducing a security risk, as well as some helpful tips for modeling and integrating with OpenFGA.
