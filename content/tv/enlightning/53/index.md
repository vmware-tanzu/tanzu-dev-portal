Secrets management poses a challenging question: how do you effectively create, rotate, and manage access, especially on a large scale? With [External Secrets Operator (ESO)](https://external-secrets.io/), you can tap into existing solutions like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to handle these secrets and seamlessly integrate them with Kubernetes.

In this session, we will eagerly share our insights into successful secrets management, aiming to strike the right balance between boosting developer productivity and addressing information security concerns. ESO facilitates secrets management in a GitOps manner, empowering self-sufficient teams to satisfy developers, auditors, and product managers alike.

ESO is the result of a community-driven endeavor, born from various open-source projects that shared a common goal: to retrieve secrets from a secret management API and integrate them into Kubernetes. In 2020, we pooled our efforts to identify a common thread among these projects, aiming to create the optimal solution to this issue - and even surpass it.

Today, we've fostered a vendor-neutral community around the project and offer a consistent custom resource API across different cloud vendors and secret management APIs. This collaborative journey exemplifies the power of collective innovation, and we are excited to continue shaping the future of secrets management.
