As a developer, incidents are unavoidable.  And the intense anxiety that they cause can feel as though they have taken years off of your life. But it doesn't have to be that way. By employing a lightweight and proven process, incidents can instead be events with a reasonable level of stress.  With this process, incidents can even improve team spirit, build trust in the organization, and lead to improvements.

Come join the discussion! Share your horror stories and we can all bond while we learn how we can do better the next time an incident occurs.
