Keptn, a CNCF project, is reducing custom coding and integrations needed for automating delivery and operation sequences by 90%. Keptn uses declarative, event and data-driven orchestration to connect and orchestrate your favorite tools (GitLab, Jenkins, Selenium, Prometheus, Litmus, Ansible, Jira â€¦). It does this as part of your DevOps & SRE automation without you having to worry about writing and maintaining tool integrations. In this session, you'll learn how Keptn works, how the community is adopting it, how you can get started in minutes, and how you can contribute to this open source project.
