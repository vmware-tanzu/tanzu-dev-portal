[cdk8s](https://cdk8s.io/) is a software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs. It aims to simplify the authoring experience of Kubernetes manifests by leveraging standard coding practices such as composition, inheritence, unit testing, and more.

In this session, we'll hear about how and why cdk8s came to be, walk through the various components of the framework, and see what you can build with it.
