[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies how applications are installed, upgraded, and managed. While Helm is a CLI-based utility, its use extends far beyond the command line.

In this session, learn about how Helm's architecture makes it easy for anyone to deploy applications of all forms to Kubernetes. The ecosystem supporting Helm has grown over the years and has expanded in ways that you might not expect. We'll explore the various tools, projects, and platforms that have adopted Helm and how you can use them to supercharge your interaction with Kubernetes. You won't believe all of the ways that Helm can be used!
