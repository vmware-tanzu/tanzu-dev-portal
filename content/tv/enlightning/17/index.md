[Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) turn application source code into runnable container images, without using Dockerfiles. Why is this useful? Buildpacks enable application developers to focus on what they do best - writing code - without having to worry about container build strategy. They also give platform operators more control over build inputs, a 'Software Bill of Materials' for images, the ability to quickly patch dependencies, and more.

Watch this episode to learn about buildpacks and how to incorporate them into your software supply chain!
