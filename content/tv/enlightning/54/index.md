[Cloud Custodian](https://cloudcustodian.io/), a CNCF incubating project, allows you to use code to manage and automate the enforcement of policies for cloud cost optimization, security, compliance, and operations⎯all without hindering developer velocity. Recently the project added support for Kubernetes and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - bringing the same experience, vocabulary, and ergonomics to enforcing policies across the three C’s⎯Cloud, Cluster, and Code.

In this session, you will learn how easy it is to read and write a policy in Cloud Custodian, plus what makes the tool so popular amongst thousands of organizations.
