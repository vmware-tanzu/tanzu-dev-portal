You've heard of policies, and you know they're important, but you've also heard it's hard so you don't know where to start. Today we're going to discuss [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), the general-purpose policy engine. With its flexible framework, OPA can be used with just about any tool or service. Once you've figured out how to write a few lines of Rego, the purpose-built policy language, you will be off to the races.
