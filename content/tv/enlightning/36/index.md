[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) is a Kubernetes-native configuration management tool that allows you to customize application manifests without the need for templates. It is integrated with kubectl and projects like Argo CD and Flux.

This session will provide an introduction to Kustomize and demonstrate how it simplifies the customization of Kubernetes manifests, without requiring knowledge of new concepts or languages. We will showcase how Kustomize works with pure YAML and how overlays can be used to provide different configurations for multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production. Additionally, we will explore the various features provided by Kustomize, including the ability to apply common labels and annotations to all Kubernetes manifests, generate ConfigMaps and Secrets, and perform rolling updates after configuration changes. Finally, we will cover how to integrate Kustomize into a GitOps flow as part of your continuous deployment strategy.
