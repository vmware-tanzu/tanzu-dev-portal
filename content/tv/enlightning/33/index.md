With the advent of HTTPS-everywhere, service meshes and zero trust infrastructure, we find that automated certificate management is more important than ever.

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) aims to be easiest way to automatically manage certificates in Kubernetes clusters. And as a CNCF incubating project, it's a really popular choice for that task, helping countless thousands of people to better handle certificates, which are truly critical infrastructure.

But even with cert-manager's help, there's still some work to ensure that everything is automated safely and that you don't get caught out by a ticking TLS time-bomb down the road!

In this session, we'll explore how (and why) cert-manager works, along with stepping into X.509 certificates, TLS and public key infrastructure (PKI) more broadly. We'll also take a look at what the cert-manager project is doing to improve security and promote safe automation of other certificate-related tasks.
