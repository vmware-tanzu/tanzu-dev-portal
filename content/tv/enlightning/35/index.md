[SchemaHero](https://schemahero.io/) is a Kubernetes operator to define and manage database schemas in a language agnostic and declarative way. Sometimes you don't know the current state of the database schema, or sometimes you just don't want to write the ALTER TABLE statements. Why not let a Kubernetes operator figure out how to get the schema from where it is now (whatever that is) to your desired, declarative schema.

In this session, we will show how SchemaHero works, walk through how to deploy and get started, and show some of the features of the operator.
