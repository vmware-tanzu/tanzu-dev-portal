[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) is an open source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution for modern applications and services. It is designed to secure applications with modern industry standards like OAuth2, OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML, and WebAuthn. 

Keycloak integrates existing security infrastructures like SAML, LDAP, and Kerberos using federation and brokerage, and you can extend it to meet your organizationâ€™s needs. 

It includes admin UIs and user self-management, which are getting even more powerful with the latest additions around dynamic user profiles.

Join host Whitney Lee and guest Alexander Schwartz to learn more!
