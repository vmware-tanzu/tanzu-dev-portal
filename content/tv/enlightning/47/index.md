[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes that allows you to write policy just like you would any other Kubernetes resource - meaning no code! Kyverno allows you to validate and mutate resources, in addition to several other actions like generating resources, verifying container image signatures, and even cleaning up resources - all based on policy-as-code but without the coding! Join us as we discover how powerful, flexible, and EASY policy can be!
