Policy-as-Code is the process of writing code that defines checks and rules. In the context of Kubernetes, these policies are used to keep clusters secure and compliant.

Since there are many ways to write code, a policy author should be granted the freedom to use the solution that works best for them or for the problem space where they are operating. This will improve the developer's productivity and the overall quality of the final code.

At the same time, this flexibility should not lead to a sprawl of policy frameworks being used, since that would cause operational complexity.

This session shows how [Kubewarden](https://www.kubewarden.io/), a CNCF project, allows policies to be expressed in different ways while still providing a standardized way to manage them.
