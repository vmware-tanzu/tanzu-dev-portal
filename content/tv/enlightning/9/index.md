We love Kubernetes and that's how we run our software. Why create it any differently? 
We're going to talk about how to tie together great Kubernetes tools for building, 
testing and deploying software. [Cartographer](https://cartographer.sh/) makes it easy to 
create a cloud native path to production; a path that lets you verify that all apps are 
safe and secure for your customers.  Join Whitney and her guest Waciuma Wanjohi to learn 
more about getting your code to production with Cartographer!
