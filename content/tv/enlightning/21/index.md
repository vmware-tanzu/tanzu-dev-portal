GitOps with Flux brings you security, reliability, velocity and more - no more pagers on Saturdays! No more breaches to the cluster that you can’t roll back. No more worrying about how you’ll fare in the next security audit. Pinky & Mae will share an overview of Flux and how it works, as well as their personal experience on why Flux has been an essential part of achieving a best-in-class delivery and platform team.
