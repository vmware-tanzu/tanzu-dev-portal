[SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)](https://github.com/getsops/) is an editor of encrypted files and is a simple way to secure and manage sensitive assets. SOPS supports YAML, JSON, ENV, INI, and binary formats. By being able to integrate with a variety of encrypted backends including AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Azure Key Vault, age, and PGP, SOPS provides a flexible way to handle one of the biggest challenges when working with infrastructure and applications: secrets.

Join this session where we will provide an in-depth look at the basic usage patterns of SOPS, the integration with several of the most popular encrypted backends, and how to integrate it into your workflows and tools. In addition, we will share the storied history of the SOPS project, its recent transition and adoption as a CNCF sandbox project, and its bright future.
