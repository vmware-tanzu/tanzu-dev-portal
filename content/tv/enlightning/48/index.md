Maybe you’ve heard about Gateway API, and are wondering things like:
* What’s it all about?
* What’s the history of Gateway API and how is it different from Ingress?
* What’s the difference between Gateway API and an API Gateway?

In short, Gateway API is a portable, expressive, extensible, and role-oriented addition to Kubernetes. It describes exposing services outside of a cluster in a general way that can be handled by many different implementations⎯21 and counting!

In this session, we’ll discuss the answers to these questions and more!
