Kubernetes is the largest of the graduated projects within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape of 100+ projects. The Kubernetes contributor community has over sixty thousand contributors across hundreds of companies. How does the work get done? What is the CNCF, anyway?  How are Kubernetes and the CNCF organized? How can you contribute to the open source community? Hint: it isn't just with code! Join Whitney as her guest Paris Pittman answers these questions and more!
