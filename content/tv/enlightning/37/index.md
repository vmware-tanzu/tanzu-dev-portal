[Emissary-ingress](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary) is a self-service API Gateway that provides powerful and battle-tested ingress for small and enterprise-scale organizations that need to get external traffic into their Kubernetes clusters and to the right services. 

Emissary-ingress's Custom Resources empower a single developer to manage all of their day-to-day configurations, but also make it easy for cluster/platform operators to manage global configuration, such as authentication and security resources. This enables developers to spend more time coding and less time deploying their services and getting traffic securely and reliably to them.

In this session, we will describe how Emissary-ingress works, walk through how to get started, and talk about some of the common features that users love in this popular CNCF Ingress project.
