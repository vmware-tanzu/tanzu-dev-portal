As Kubernetes becomes the backbone of modern infrastructure, securing multi-tenant clusters becomes a top priority for platform engineering teams.

In this lightboard session, we will delve into the realm of zero-trust architecture, exploring how it can bolster security measures and mitigate lateral surface attack risks within Kubernetes environments. We'll showcase best practices and practical guidance for implementing a robust zero-trust model and how [Paralus](https://www.paralus.io/)' centralized RBAC and authentication features work together seamlessly to simplify cluster management, enhance security, and streamline RBAC operations.
