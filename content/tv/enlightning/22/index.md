Imagine you're managing one or more shared Kubernetes clusters for multiple dev teams. The experience these teams have with container orchestration, networking, etc. will probably vary. Some folks are keen to get the most out of the platform, while others want to focus on developing and don't care too much about the underlying infrastructure.

If you're on the platform team, it is on you to design a way that will allow for these different needs, while still being maintainable and scalable.

Virtual clusters can help with that! Let's find out how. Together!
