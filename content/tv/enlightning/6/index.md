What is Knative Serving, and how does it help you simplify and enhance the way that your 
application runs on Kubernetes? How does it work? What components are at play? In what ways
is running an app on Knative superior to running it directly on Kubernetes?  Join in the 
conversation as host Whitney Lee and her guest Carlos Santana discuss (and draw!) the answers
to these questions and more!
