How do you know that the software you're running on your laptop or in production is actually the software you think you're running? Attackers may try to modify source code or compiled binaries/containers as they move about the internet and your network. We can check the authenticity of software and other digital artifacts with digital signatures. But, in practice, almost nobody does!

In this episode, we'll see why not, and what the [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) project is doing to fix that. We'll explore digital signatures, losing your Yubikey on the street, why the price of security for OSS projects should be zero, how you achieve more security by promising less, and why software signatures need "sunshine laws," all in the context of the Sigstore project and its constituent components Fulcio, Rekor, and Cosign. You'll learn how the OSS ecosystem is getting more secure every day and how you can apply the same tools and principles.
