Knative Eventing resources are loosely coupled, and can be developed and deployed independently of one another.  
This enables developers to use an event-driven architecture with their Kubernetes applications.  How does it work, 
and what does it take to get started?  Come hang out with Whitney and Mauricio as they discuss (and draw!) the main
