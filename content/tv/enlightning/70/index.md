Yahoo developed and open sourced a service authentication and role-based authorization system called [Athenz](http://www.athenz.io/) to address the core zero trust principles. Yahoo uses Athenz to bootstrap their instances deployed in both private and public clouds with service identities in the form of short-lived x.509 certificates that allow one service to securely communicate with another. Authentication by itself is not sufficient though, authenticated clients require explicit authorization to be allowed to perform actions and Athenz enables fine-grained role-based (RBAC) access control with industry-standard mTLS bound JWT access tokens.
