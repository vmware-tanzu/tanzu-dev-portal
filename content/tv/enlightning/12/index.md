The most efficient way to observe application behavior relies on metrics, key/value pairs of 
numerical data. Capturing and processing metrics can help you identify and respond to potential 
issues before they escalate and cause more serious problems. But what should you measure? What 
do those measurements really mean? Attendees will leave the talk with an understanding of how 
application metrics align with other observability and monitoring methods, from profiling to 
tracing. Weâ€™ll also look at the limits of aggregation when working with dimensional metrics, 
and why your pretty dashboards might be lying to you.
