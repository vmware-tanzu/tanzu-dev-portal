All those fresh CI builds end up taking up a lot of bandwidth: someone has to pay for it! Paul joins Cot√© again to talk about the rising trend in open source projects that need to find container download patrons. In doing so, we also discuss Helm briefly. Also, we discuss some new ideas for Tanzu TV formats.
