Right now there’s no end of possibilities for technology-driven innovation in healthcare. Coté and JT Perry discussed this state in part one of the conversation, and it part two they go over examples of those innovations. First, they discuss what FHIR (in the US) is and how it creates new opportunities for better patient care. Also, discussed: the software development tool-chain for more innovation in healthcare, at-home devices to reduce hospital stays, and API implementation and management.
