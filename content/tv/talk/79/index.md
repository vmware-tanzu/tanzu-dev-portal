The US healthcare industry will likely see a lot of changes in the next five years - there's already a lot going on with mergers and new services forced by the pandemic. In this episode, fresh from working in the healthcare industry, JT Perry talks with Coté about all that horizon 2 and 3 stuff. The recent introduction of APIs and data interoperability is one of the more interesting topics. This is part one - in part two, we'll discuss the tools and practices companies can use to be part of this innovation.
