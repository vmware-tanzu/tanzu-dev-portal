Now, the show! Worrying about “lock-in” is bogus if you don’t consider the nuances of the idea, the problems you’re solving, and the footing you want. Plus, three links on OKRs, multi-cloud, and OSS developer tools for kubernetes. 

Mentioned:

- Supercloud vs. multi-cloud/PaaS: https://www.platformonomics.com/2022/01/supercloudifragilisticexpialidocious-ii-questions-remain/
