In this episode, I discuss four software and operations metrics to start with when you’re doing your digital transformation, app modernization stuff: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, time to restore service, and change failure rate. 

Also, I discuss my thoughts on TRRS vs. TRS cables, and USB-C variations.
