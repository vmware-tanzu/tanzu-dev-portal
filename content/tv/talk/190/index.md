76% of respondents in our State of Kubernetes 2023 survey say they use multiple clouds - they're multi-cloud.

@thecote looks at the driving forces behind multi-cloud adoption, most notably the desire to avoid vendor lock-in.

For more insights into multi-cloud strategies, Kubernetes benefits, and the challenges being tackled by your peers, check out the VMware State of Kubernetes 2023 survey: https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/stateofkubernetes-2023?utm_source=cote&utm_campaign=devrel&utm_content=StateOfK8s2023_03_multi-cloud&utm_medium=youtube

📌 Key Highlights:

1. Multi-Cloud Understanding: Multi-cloud essentially refers to all the computing resources an organization utilizes - traditional VMs, bare metal, public and private cloud services.
2. Growth & Expansion: As organizations grow, they are likely to accumulate a variety of cloud environments. This growth can be through organic expansion or through acquisitions and mergers.
3. VMware State of Kubernetes 2023 Survey: According to this survey, 76% of respondents, particularly large organizations with 1000+ employees, utilize multiple clouds.
4. Application Deployment: Applications are planned to be run not only on the public cloud but also on edge locations which can include on-premises sites such as warehouses or stores.
5. Vendor Lock-In: The primary reason organizations use a multi-cloud strategy is to avoid vendor dependence, or "lock-in". Organizations want the freedom to change their cloud services provider if necessary.
6. Role of Kubernetes: Kubernetes serves as a layer that allows freedom from vendor lock-in. It provides application portability across different cloud environments.
7. Transition to Integrated Platforms: If maintaining an internally built Kubernetes platform becomes unsustainable, organizations may transition to a more integrated or commercial version of the platform.
