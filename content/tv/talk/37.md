You hear the phrase "business value" a lot in agile talk. It sounds like something important! In this episode, Cot√© talks with Robbie Clutton to get a good idea about what business value is, how to define it for an organization, and then what to do about. Robbie uses an example from retail to illustrate the explanation.
