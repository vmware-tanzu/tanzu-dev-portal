In this episode, we check in on the Spring community by looking at the most recent State of Spring survey. While in survey land, we look at the Dynatrace Kubernetes in the Wild study: what are the top languages used in kubernetes, and how is on-premises use shaping up. Also, SpringOne was great, and now there's so much more of it each week until the next SpringOne this fall. And, check out how smooth Ben is at picking up MC duties when Cot√©'s internet stops working.
