The US healthcare industry will likely see a lot of changes in the next five years - there's already a lot going on with mergers and new services forced by the pandemic. In this episode, fresh from working in the healthcare industry, JT Perry talks with Cot√© about all that horizon 2 and 3 stuff. The recent introduction of APIs and data interoperability is one of the more interesting topics. This is part one - in part two, we'll discuss the tools and practices companies can use to be part of this innovation.
