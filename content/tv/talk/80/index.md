We discuss how Yapı Kredi Bank has been moving their approach to software from a  project mindset to a product mindset. Part of this re-organizing around product lines. To do this, the team analyzed their portfolio of 300+ apps and to define the products. As IT has been evolving, they're now working on transforming their relationship with the business side as well. We also discuss building up bi-directional trust between management and staff, banking security and regulations, and so much more. Enjoy!
