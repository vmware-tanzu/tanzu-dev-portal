This week, @thecote and @BenWilcockBen talk about using AI for software development, and general text use. They check in on Kubernetes usability for application developers, and give their takes on the recent microservices vs. monoliths dust-up. There's a bonus discussions about cycling in London and regional sausage taxonomies, right at the beginning to whet your appetite.
