More than likely, your initial ideas for your apps will be wrong. You’re probably not even solving the most important problems. Pivotal Lab’s “Discovery and Framing” process is built around making sure you’re working on the right apps and features to meet your original goals. In today’s episode, I cover the discovery and framing idea as, er, framed up by Matt Parker in his book Radically Collaborative Patterns for Software Makers. Also, I go over a case study of this from the food services industry.
