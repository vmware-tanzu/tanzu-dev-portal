I still don’t really get what Backstage.io is and what makes it more than just a “portal.” But, it seems important…? So, come learn with me today on Tanzu Talk as I watch some demos and presentations on it. Plus, three recommended links.

Jan 19th, 2pm CET. Forrester’s take on platforms, study of ROI and input on doing your own business case, an overview of Tanzu here (replay available): https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/webinars/jan-19-emea-the-adaptive-enterprise-can-your-application-platform-cope-with-a-crisis?utm_campaign=EMEA_P5_WB_Q422_Webinar_Tanzu-Advisory-Forum-Pan-EMEA&utm_source=cote&utm_medium=social
