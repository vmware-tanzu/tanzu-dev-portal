Cot√© puts together a talk looking out how to use things like OpenAI ChatGPT to make digital transformation, DevOps/culture, whatever and etc. better, if not just less annoying.

1:04:34 - More ideas on how to use ChatGPT based on arguing for pair programming. Primarily, does it take longer than just writing it yourself?
