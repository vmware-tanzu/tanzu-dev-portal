One of the main reasons transforming an organization is so hard is because you’re changing thousands of people’s habits. Changing just one person’s habits - your own! - is hard enough. Coté tells us a helpful way to think about habit change.

For more reading on changing habits, the airport book out at the moment is Atomic Habits - it’s really good!
