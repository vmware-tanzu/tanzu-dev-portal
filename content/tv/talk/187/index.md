📌 Key Highlights:

1. Security and Governance Tools - As Kubernetes enters the mainstream and is utilized for more core applications, there’s a rise in the usage of security and governance tools. With apps in later stages of development, they're now subject to standard enterprise governance, leading to increased scrutiny and tool usage.
2. Paying for tools - The survey also asked participants about the types of tools they're willing to pay for. The results indicate that security and governance tools are highly valued. In addition, monitoring and alerting tools are seeing increased interest, which comes as no surprise given their importance in maintaining a healthy infrastructure.
3. Service Mesh Adoption - 92% of organizations reported having a service mesh in place. While it may seem like an exotic tool, the survey results show that most organizations are using either open source or commercial service mesh solutions.
