"75% of IT and business executives say that their companies‚Äô ability to compete is directly related to their ability to release quality software quickly" reads a recent Forrester Consulting report. If that‚Äôs the case, why are so many developer in large organizations have a bad developer experience? Paul Kelly wrote up the case for good DevEx and what it looks like for developers on the VMware Tanzu blog recently. In this episode, Cora and Cot√© talk with him about the blog. Paul also wrote two books on Visual COBOL so, naturally, we open up by talking about COBOL. Why did we ever need more?
