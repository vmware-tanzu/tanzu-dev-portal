When you have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people in your software organization, changing all of them over to a product approach to software is daunting. Here, Coté goes over three ways he’s seen large organizations scale that kind of change: starting small and seeding people from initial projects into new projects; set the mindset to transforming your existing organization not creating a new organization; create your own brand and adapting methodology, making sure to do internal marketing (advocacy) and quarterly internal conferences.
