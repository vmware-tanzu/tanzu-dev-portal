Software is evolving the nature of cars and how they function faster than, maybe, any other device. Software, ubiquitous networking (like 5G), machine learning and storage are enabling much of this. Of course, humans are still needed too, often in the form of data scientists. To explore all that, in this Tanzu Talk episode, Coté talks with  Florian Baumann, CTO for Automotive and AI at Dell Technologies. Florian also discusses a tiny bit of  how machine learning works.
