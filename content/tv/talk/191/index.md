We talk about getting PCI compliance into Kubernetes, and other security think in the cloud native world. Securing Tanzu Application Service and Tanzu Application Platform. David Zendzian talks with Cora and Coté about what exactly “security” means in the cloud native context. They use his upcoming paper on PCI compliance as an example throughout.
