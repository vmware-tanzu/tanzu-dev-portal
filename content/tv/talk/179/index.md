You've been asked to build a cloud native cloud platform. The developers need some containers, probably some orchestration. So, what do you now? In this episode, Cot√© talks with ITQ's Robert Kloosterhuis about just this topic. Drawing on Robert's background as a virtualization admin and now, the Tanzu portfolio of stuff, they go through the type of thinking and work ITQ does with customers.
