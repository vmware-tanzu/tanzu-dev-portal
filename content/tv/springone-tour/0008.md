Streams, batches, and microservices. Oh My! Data integration and related workloads are at the foundation of all enterprise workloads. They ingest streams of events. They process large batches. How do we develop applications to address these kind of workloads while taking advantage of modern cloud infrastructure to deploy and monitor them?
