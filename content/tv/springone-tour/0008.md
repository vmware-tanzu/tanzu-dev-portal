Streams, batches, and microservices. Oh My! Data integration and related workloads are at the foundation of all enterprise workloads. They ingest streams of events. They process large batches. How do we develop applications to address these kind of workloads while taking advantage of modern cloud infrastructure to deploy and monitor them?

We will look at Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Function and how they relate to stream processing as well as Spring Cloud Task and Spring Batch and how they relate to handling finite workloads. In both cases, we will be sure to dig into the newer features that make your life easier in the deployment of these mission critical workloads. We will also look at orchestrating and monitoring these applications via Spring Cloud Data Flow and related tools.
