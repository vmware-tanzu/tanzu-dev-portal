Please join Nate Schutta and guest Soby Chacko. Soby is a core committer to Spring Cloud Stream and a co-lead for Spring for Apache Pulsar and the Kafka binders in Spring Cloud Stream. He is also a contributor to various other Spring projects at VMware. He loves solving event-driven and distributed stream processing system complexities, and he aims to address the gaps with the help of Spring Cloud Stream.
