Please join Nate Schutta and guest Allen Holub (http://holub.com, @allenholub, allen@holub.com), an internationally recognized software architect and Agile consultant/trainer. Allen speaks all over the planet about these topics and agile-friendly implementation technology like microservices and incremental/evolutionary architecture. He provides in-house training and consulting as well. Allen excels at building highly functional Lean/Agile organizations and designing and building robust, highly scalable software suitable for agile environments. He's served as a CTO (twice), but started out as a grunt programmer, and has built systems ranging from compilers and operating systems to web applications. Allen is widely published (10 books, many hundreds of articles both in print and online) and was a Contributing Editor at both Dr. Dobb's Journal and JavaWorld. His many video classes have been published by Pluralsight (Swift in Depth, Picturing Architecture, Object-Oriented Design), LinkedIn Learning (Architecture Fundamentals, and Domain-Driven Design), and O’Reilly (Design Patterns in the Real World). If you'd like to bring Allen in house for consulting or training work, set up a chat at https://holub.com/chat to discuss your needs.
