Please join Nate Schutta and guest Michael Feathers. Michael is the Founder and Director of R7K Research & Conveyance, a company specializing in software and organization design. Prior to forming R7K, Michael was the Chief Scientist of Obtiva and a consultant with Object Mentor International. Over the past 20 years he has consulted with hundreds of organizations, supporting them with general software design issues, process change and code revitalization. He is a frequent presenter at national and international conferences.

He was involved in the early Agile movement and one of his passions is helping organizations recognize the impact of their internal organization and communication on the long term viability of their software products - putting interactions in place to prevent the accumulation of technical debt and lost business opportunities.

His goal is to make software development more effective and integrated with business concerns. He is the author of the books: Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Brutal Refactoring: More Working Effectively with Legacy Code. His main specialties are software development practices, TDD, Refactoring, Legacy Code Revitalization, and team dynamics.
