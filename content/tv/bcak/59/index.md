Please join Nate Schutta and guest Caitlin Mahoney! Caitlin is a technical recruiter and startup consultant. She founded Sandpiper Talent in 2020 with a mission to make the ethos and quality of a robust, in-house talent acquisition team available to early-stage startups. She primarily works with pre-seed, seed, and series A founders that do not yet have an internal talent team, helping them put foundational processes in place and hire key team members who will get them to the next level.  

After-hours, you'll find her connecting with others in tech and VC, learning and sharing how to create great products and workplaces. She takes great joy in introducing individuals who mutually enable each other to accomplish goals, and she is a ready advocate for diversity and mentorship.
