Please join Nate Schutta and DaShaun Carter, a Partner Solution Architect for Redis Labs. A husband, father of four, volunteer and reluctant athlete. Deliberately practicing to build better software, faster. Generalist. Computer Science. MBA. Continuously learning. Believes that every rep counts. Doesn't have anything figured out. Still trying to prove to himself that the sacrifices that his parents made for him, were worth it. Trying to get a little better every day.
