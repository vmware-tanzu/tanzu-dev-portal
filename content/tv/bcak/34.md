Please join Nate Schutta and guest Sam Newman, author, speaker, and independent consultant interested in cloud, continuous delivery and microservices. Aside from other things I've spoken at more than a few conferences, and wrote some things including the books Building Microservices and Monolith To Microservices for O'Reilly.
