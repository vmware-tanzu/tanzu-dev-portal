Please join Nate Schutta and guest Aasta Frascati-Robinson, who likes to make things with fun people. Brainstorming together, picking up whatever we need to make it happen makes for great days. My creative work draws from the beauty of many different emotions in life and celebrating the unique perspectives we all bring to it. Be it smiles, tears, or the many in betweens, feeling is where it’s at. I work best in exploratory environments that foster creativity with a people-first mentality, open to action to address diverse team needs. The most fun projects I’ve worked on have involved communities, many mediums, learning new things, and an energetic atmosphere with awesome people. Feel free to contact to collaborate. :)
