Please join Nate Schutta and guest Abel Salgado! Abel is a developer on VMwareâ€™s Spring Commercial team, making Kubernetes and Spring integration for APIs nice & easy. That while dealing with personal obsessions with performance, hardware architectures, testing and documentation tools. Outside of work, he is a staff member of Barcelona JUG helping organize JBCNConf in Barcelona, and acts as janitor for the Asciidoctor Maven Plugin.
