Please join Nate Schutta and Michael Carducci, a hands-on software architect, consultant, entrepreneur, entertainer and speaker with a reputation for doing the impossible. Over the past two decades he has gained experience and insights from a variety of roles spanning the full project life-cycle and numerous technologies.

In addition to his experience in the technology industry, Michael has earned equal recognition and renown as an award-winning professional magician and mentalist. This pursuit has earned him a unique perspective on problem solving, human psychology, and communication.

In the before times, when not on the road speaking, coding, or performing; Michael could be found exploring the mountains of Colorado on two wheels, jumping out of perfectly good airplanes, or deep under water exploring shipwrecks and reefs. These days it’s mainly just a lot of Netflix…
