Please join Nate Schutta and guest Billy Korando. Billy is a developer advocate with Oracle, part of the Java Platform Group, Developer Relations team. Before moving over to developer advocacy he worked as a developer and consultant for over a decade working in a variety of fields including; insurance regulation, electronic health records, shipping, finance, and government. Working with so many organizations across different fields has given him an opportunity to see the unique challenge organizations face, as well as the common struggles we all face.

When Billy is not writing or talking about software development, he enjoys traveling, watching the Royals and Chiefs (who often break his heart), cycling, and playing kickball.
