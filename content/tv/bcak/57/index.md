Please join Nate Schutta and guest Ben Wilcock! Ben is a boomerang employee, having already worked multiple times with VMware and Pivotal over the past 6 years. During his time with VMware Ben has been a Java Solution Architect working in the field with VMware Tanzu Labs customers, and he spent 2 years as Technical Marketing Manager for Spring. Ben left for pastures new in 2021, but now heâ€™s back in his dream role helping to articulate the benefits of the new Tanzu Application Platform to developers across the globe.

Away from work, Ben has a young-ish family, so spare time is a bit of a fantasy. But when time does allow, he likes to take some outdoor exercise (walking, cycling), watch movies and TV, play games (mostly troubleshooting), enjoy stargazing, and even build and paint the occasional scale model.

In recent years Ben has become a Desktop Linux convert having already driven both Windows and MacOS during his 20+ years in the IT industry. His current Linux distro of choice is Fedora, having recently made the switch from the excellent Pop!_OS.
