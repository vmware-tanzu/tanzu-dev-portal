Please join Nate Schutta and Luca Mezzalira, Principal Architect at AWS, International Speaker and O'Reilly author. In his own words: Being associated with the industry since 2004, I have lent my expertise predominantly in the solution architecture field.

My colleagues know me as an excellent communicator who believes in using an interactive approach for understanding and solving problems of varied scopes. I helped DAZN becoming a global OTT platform in just 5 years, now as Principal Architect at AWS, I’m helping our customers in the media and entertainment space to deliver cost-effective and scalable cloud solutions for their customers. Finally, I’m sharing with the community the best practices to develop cloud-native architectures solving technical and organizational challenges.
