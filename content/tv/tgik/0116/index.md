Come hang out with Bryan Liles as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Bryan talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Bryan exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!
