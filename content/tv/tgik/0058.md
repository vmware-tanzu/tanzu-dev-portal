Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will be covering the new minimal VMM from AWS called Firecracker. I&#39;ll explain what a VMM is, how it relates to containers and Kubernetes and why this is a cool new building block.  We&#39;ll go through the getting started instructions to get it up and running (on GCP with nested virtualization).
