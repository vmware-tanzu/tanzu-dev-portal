Notes archived at https://github.com/heptio/tgik/blob/master/episodes/089/README.md

Content around Tekton starts about 20 minutes in.

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will be looking at the Tekton CD project.  This is an offshoot of KNative and one of the inaugural projects for the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).
