- 00:00:00 - Welcome to TGIK!
- 00:03:25 - Week in Review
- 00:19:11 - Ko
- 00:49:42 - Configula

Notes: https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tgik/blob/master/episodes/102/README.md

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we&#39;ll be looking at a couple of interesting deployment tools.  First will be ko (https://github.com/google/ko).  This is a go focused tool that really streamlines the building and deployment of go based services.  Second will be Configula from Brendan Burns (https://github.com/brendandburns/configula).  This TGIK8s is a lightening round!
