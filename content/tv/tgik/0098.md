Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we are looking at the CUE templating language (https://cuelang.org/).  This is a unique and interesting approach to wrangling YAML. Join Joe as he figures out what it is all about.
