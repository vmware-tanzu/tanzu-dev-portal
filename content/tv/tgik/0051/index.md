Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

Linkerd 2.0 just launched! I&#39;ll be looking at the announcement and work to get my hands dirt playing with it. I haven&#39;t used it in a while and there is a lot new so we&#39;ll all be learning together.
