Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics.  Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well.  Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience.  Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

Not everything goes as planned, but with the help of the watchers we figure it out and get Istio up and running on Kubernetes.

A fix for the issue that we hit is outlined here: https://github.com/istio/istio/pull/333.  Hopefully this&#39;ll get merged soon.
