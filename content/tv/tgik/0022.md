Content on Nuclio starts at about 20:00 in.

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week we will look at Nuclio -- a serverless system that is aimed at real time and data driven applications.  How does this compare with some of the other serverless systems out there? What makes it for &#34;real time and data driven apps&#34;?  How does it work when I try to install on a k8s cluster that they don&#39;t have explicit instructions around?
