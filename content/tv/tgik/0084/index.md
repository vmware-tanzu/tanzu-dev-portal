Come hang out with Duffie Cooley as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Duffie talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Duffie exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week I&#39;ll be demonstrating a cluster with the soon to be remove apis already removed. We will explore how that affects your use of Kubernetes and what you can do to mitigate the problem should you hit it!
