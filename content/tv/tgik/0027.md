Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

With the recent report of Tesla being compromised by having an open kubernetes dashboard, it seems like a good time to review best practices for both the dashboard and other similar services. We&#39;ll look at the current security model of the Kubernetes dashboard and explore using an authenticating proxy to secure any internal facing web service.
