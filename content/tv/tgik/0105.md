- 00:00:00 - We lcome to TGIK!
- 00:03:26 - Week in Review
- 00:16:35 - Start dapr exploration

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we&#39;ll be looking at dapr (https://dapr.io). This is &#34;an event-driven, portable runtime for building microservices on cloud and edge.&#34; Joe will be installing it and checking out how it works.
