Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week we will be exploring resource limits (CPU, RAM, etc.) along with resource quotas. We&#39;ll explore how these work, how to set them and some best practices.  We also cover heapster and how it collects resource statistics.

Thanks for watching!  I&#39;ll be off for 3 weeks with Thanksgiving and conferences.  See you in December!
