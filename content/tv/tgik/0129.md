Come hang out with Duffie Cooley and Ian Coldwater as they do a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and security related topics. Some of this will be them talking about the things they know. Some of this will be exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!
