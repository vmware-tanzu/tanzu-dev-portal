Come hang out with Joe as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we are covering Vertical Pod Autoscaling (https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler) and the Metrics Server (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server). This is a way to automatically set and adjust limits on pods.  This is a new area for Joe so come explore and learn with him!
