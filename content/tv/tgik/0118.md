UPDATE: Change of plans! Joe had a meeting conflict pop up last minute so Duffie is going to jump in and get started on this topic.  We will be experimenting to see if Joe can join live as soon as he is done with his meeting. 

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we&#39;ll be digging into kubectl plugins and how they work.  We&#39;ll look at Krew, the plugin manager and try to find time to look into some (audience) favorite plugins.
