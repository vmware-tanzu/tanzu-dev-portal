Kris Nova is guest starring this week on TGIK! 

Come hang out with Kris Nova as she does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Kris talking about the things she knows well. Some of this will be Kris exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week Kris will be exploring Helm. We will start by installing Helm on a new Kubernetes cluster. We will be installing an existing helm chart, and creating a new one from scratch for the Java Prototype application.
