This week we are going to do a deep(er) dive on Sealed Secrets (https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets).  This is a way to encrypt secrets in a way where you can check them in and manage them with the rest of your gitops-ish workflow.  In this deeper dive where we plan to peek under the cover and look at some of the day 2 things like key rotation.
