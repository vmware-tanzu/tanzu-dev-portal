Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will look at Velero (https://velero.io).  Velero (formally called Heptio Ark) is a backup and disaster recovery tool for Kubernetes. We&#39;ve been working on this for quite a while and it recently hit 1.0.
