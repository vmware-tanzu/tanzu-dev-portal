Join us as we surf through the design and architecture of different CNI providers. (Antrea, Calico, and maybe some others if we have time), looking at how they bootstrap themselves in different OS's, how they reuse core CNI logic and library components,  and how they setup daemonsets (agents) as well as CNI controllers for integrating NetworkPolicy information.
