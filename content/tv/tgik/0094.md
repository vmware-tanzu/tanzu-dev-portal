SPIFFE/SPIRE content starts at 16:55.

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we are looking at SPIFFE and SPIRE! These are CNCF projects that help to give workloads identity that can be used across all sorts of infrastructure. Learn about the ideas here, watch me deploy SPIRE to k8s and ask questions about where this stuff is going.
