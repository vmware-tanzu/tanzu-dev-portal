Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will look at OPA! It is a policy evaluation engine that just moved to the CNCF incubating level of support.  We&#39;ll learn about the basics of OPA along with how it is typically used in Kubernetes.
 
See https://github.com/heptio/tgik/tree/master/episodes/071 for notes and code.

Coverage of OPA starts around 11:00
