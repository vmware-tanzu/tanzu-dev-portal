Come hang out with Joe as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we are going to explore CDK8s (https://cdk8s.io/). This is the Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes made by our friends over at AWS.  It is a set of libraries (primarily typescript) for generating Kubernetes config/yaml.  Joe doesn't know typescript so this should be fun...
