Episode notes up at https://github.com/heptio/tgik/blob/master/episodes/092/README.md.

Work on the controller starts at 00:23:43.

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

In this episode we will pick up where we left off with the Minecraft controller we started in https://tgik.io/083.  We&#39;ll be doing some coding and exploring what it takes to build an operator/controller.
