Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week we&#39;ll be continuing to look at Knative. We&#39;ll dig deeper into the serving abstractions and perhaps start looking at the &#34;build&#34; components&#34;
