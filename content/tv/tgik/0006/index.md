Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

In this episode Joe uses kubeadm to stand up a cluster using raw AWS instances.  He goes into some of the details of what is happening under the covers.  You can use this process to get Kubernetes set up on *any* set of linux machines.
