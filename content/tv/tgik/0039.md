Lots more details on this episode (including the YAML used) at https://github.com/heptio/tgik/tree/master/episodes/039.

Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we&#39;ll be exploring setting up cluster auth with a combination of GitHub, Dex (from CoreOS/Red Hat) and Heptio Gangway.  We&#39;ll also mix in a little Contour and Cert Manager.  The end result will be a secure auth framework as a building block for a multi-team cluster.
