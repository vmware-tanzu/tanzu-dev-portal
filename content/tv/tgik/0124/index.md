Come hang out with Joe as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we are covering KUDO (https://kudo.dev/).  KUDO is the Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator.  It is a structured toolkit for creating operators.  Lots of interesting ideas and examples to dig into.
