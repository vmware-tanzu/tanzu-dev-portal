Dive in with Jay and Ricardo as we taste the entire Kubernetes rainbow ! In this session we'll try out a bunch of different Kubernetes distros (some for development, and some familiar products you might already use), to see what tools are best for playing with different aspects of the Kubernetes ecosystem, taking special care to look at storage, networking, and other add-ons that come out of the box.
