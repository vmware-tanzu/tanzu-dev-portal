Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will look at kube2iam and kiam. These are systems that aim to bridge the world of Kubernetes with AWS from an auth perspective.
 
See https://github.com/heptio/tgik/tree/master/episodes/070 for notes and code.

Coverage of kiam starts around 12:00
