Join Pushkar with Christoph from SSE - Secure Systems Engineering GmbH, as we explore, why having signed images only is not enough. But having a way to verify them for each workload, is equally important. In this episode we will explore Connaisseur project that acts as an admission controller to verify signed images at deployment time.
