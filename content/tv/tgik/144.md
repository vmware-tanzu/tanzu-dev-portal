Come hang out with Jay Vyas and hack around w/ windows and various CNI providers in EKS, VSphere, and beyond.  We'll also look at what running containerd in windows looks like, and go through the basics of  "omg, im so used to linux, how do i do this stuff in windows?' for those of you in the K8s community that are just getting started with Kubernetes on Windows !
