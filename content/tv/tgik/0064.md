Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will look at Pulumi. Pulumi is a solution for creating and managing cloud configs.  We are going to look at it through the lens of Kubernetes but it can also do a whole lot more!

See https://github.com/heptio/tgik/tree/master/episodes/064 for notes and code.
