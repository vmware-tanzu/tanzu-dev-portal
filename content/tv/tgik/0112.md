Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we&#39;ll be digging into webhook admission controllers! We&#39;ll dive into the code and code up a new one (based on the upstream test image) install it and see how it works.
