Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

In this episode, Joe will be continue to build the controller he started in TGIK 007 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xo_ghCIOSY).  After taking a 3 week break from TGIK, Joe is going to take a step back and take a simpler approach to building this. Come hear what he got wrong the first time and watch as he fixes it.
