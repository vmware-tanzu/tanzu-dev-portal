Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week we will look at kube-deploy. This is an early project that reexamines how to build and scale clusters using the &#34;Cluster API&#34;. We&#39;ll talk about how this builds on top of kubeadm and look at an early version in action on GCP.
