Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

Deploying applications to Kubernetes is one thing. But what about developing on Kubernetes? How do you use Kubernetes to run your application in an environment that is similar to production?

Finishing our our series on developer tools for working with Kubernetes, we are looking at Draft from Microsoft.  https://draft.sh/.  Draft automates creating/rebuilding and launching apps on Kubernetes.
