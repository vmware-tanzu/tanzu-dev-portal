Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week Joe will be digging into the Fission serverless framework.  This is a continuation from last week when he looked at kubeless.  We&#39;ll be starting from scratch and see how far we can get.  We will also compare and contrast approaches.
