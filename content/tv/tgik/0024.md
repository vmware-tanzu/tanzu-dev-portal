Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

This week we&#39;ll dig into the Kubernetes &#34;Job&#34; primitive. We&#39;ll look at how it works, how it compares to other controllers like Deployments and common usage patterns.
