Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics.  Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well.  Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience.  Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

In this episode we cover the various parameters on the Pod object and how those interact to provide reliable service.  See Joe kill AWS instances out from under Kubernetes and have Kubernetes continue without missing a beat.  Learn how liveness and readiness probes work to make sure that services stay up and only serve traffic when they want to.  Watch Joe learn new things about Kubernetes that he didn&#39;t already know.

Please keep the comments coming!  New topic ideas always welcome.
