Come hang out with Duffie Cooley as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Duffie talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Duffie exploring something secret with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!
