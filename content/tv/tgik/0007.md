Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

In this episode, Joe will be building a new controller using Go.  Learn how controllers work and a bit about how to build one.  Also watch Joe, most probably, looks stuff up on Stack Overflow.
