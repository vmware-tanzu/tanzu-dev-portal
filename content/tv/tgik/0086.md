Join Duffie Cooley as he returns to TGIK to explore some resources around understanding Kubernetes as a system. We&#39;ll explore some of the tooling out there that helps build a mental model of the system itself and how all the parts of Kubernetes work together.

Come hangout, ask questions, and share you experiences!
