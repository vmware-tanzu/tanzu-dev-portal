Come hang out with Joe Beda (@jbeda) as he explores the Kubernetes ecosystem.  Hang out as we explore something NEW for the first time.

This week we'll be looking at the Pulumi Kubernetes Operator. This is a way to take a Pulumi deployment program and turn it into an operator so that it can be actuated via the k8s API. Hopefully we'll have someone from Pulumi join us to make sure we don't go too far off the rails!
