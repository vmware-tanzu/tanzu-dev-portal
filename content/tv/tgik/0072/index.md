Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we will look at Kustomize! A (now built in) system for managing and Kustomizing your Kubernetes manafests via patches.

If we have time we&#39;ll examine some other up and coming solutions in this space.
 
See https://github.com/heptio/tgik/tree/master/episodes/072 for notes and code.
