Come hang out with Joe Beda as he does a bit of hands on exploration of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows well. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Ask questions, comment and help decide where things go.

In this episode, Joe will be continue to build the controller he started in TGIK 007 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xo_ghCIOSY).  Some great progress was made in TGIK 008 and we&#39;ll look to finish up in this episode.
