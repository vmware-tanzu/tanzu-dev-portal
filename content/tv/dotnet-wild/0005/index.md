Layla is joined by Corey Weathers, a Developer Evangelist at Twilio who is passionate about sharing how magical 
software can be. Whether coding or coaching at hackathons, speaking at tech conferences & 
meetups, or livestreaming app development on Twitch for Twilio TV, Corey uses each 
experience to inspire and equip developers. In addition to his time at Twilio, he has worked in a 
variety of software development roles over the past 16 years at the IRS, Microsoft and others. 
Corey holds an MBA from the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, and a BS in Systems & 
Computer Science from Howard University. While a native New Yorker at heart, he’s proud to 
make central PA home with his family.
