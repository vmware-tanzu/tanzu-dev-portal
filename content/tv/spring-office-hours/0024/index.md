This is your chance to stay connected to what’s happening with the Spring Framework, related projects, and the community. During this live show, Dan and DaShaun are joined by special guest, Glenn Renfro.  Glenn will be discussing Spring Cloud Data Flow.

Spring Cloud Data Flow is a cloud-native data integration and orchestration platform that allows developers to build, orchestrate, and manage data pipelines using a simple web interface or command-line interface. It supports a wide range of data sources and sinks, as well as various transformation and processing options, and integrates with Spring Cloud Stream and Spring Cloud Task to enable the creation of event-driven and microservices-based data pipelines. It is useful for a wide range of data integration and orchestration use cases, such as analytics, machine learning, and more.
