Join Dan Veg and DaShaun Carter as they discuss testing your Spring Boot applications. With Spring Boot, batteries are included, and you are set up for success when it comes to testing out of the box. In this episode, we will discuss what is included, so you know when to reach for the correct tool.

This is your chance to stay connected to what's happening with the Spring Framework, related projects, and the community. During this live show, Dan and DaShaun will review the current news, demo a Spring-related project they find interesting, and answer any questions you might have.
