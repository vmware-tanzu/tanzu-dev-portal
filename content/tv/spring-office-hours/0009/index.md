It’s 10 pm, do you know where your relational data store is?

When people build apps and need a data persistence solution, they reach for a relational one over 80% of the time. So when a developer come to Spring, imagine their reaction when they see these choices:

- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Data JDBC
- R2dbcTemplate
- Spring Data R2DBC

What is a developer to do? Tune in to hear Spring Data JPA project lead Greg Turnquist talk about the role each of these vital pieces of the Spring portfolio plays and how to choose which one to use in your next (or current) project
