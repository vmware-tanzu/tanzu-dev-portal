We started our journey in 2018 with an uphill task to re-engineer a decade-old monolith wealth management application towards a nimble and modern architecture. The existing system was not able to meet the business expectations of on-demand release, quicker time to market with new features, easier integration with vendors to digitize business processes, scalability, resiliency, and availability requirements as per growing needs, etc. with 35+ integration touch points. Our goal was to build a modern and easy-to-use digital wealth management platform for advisors/financial professionals and their clients to collaborate better and transform the value chain with an engineering transformation initiative. We opted for microservices-oriented architecture supporting a simplified integration landscape and end-to-end digital experience unification meeting the nonfunctional requirements of release on demand, elasticity in terms of scalability, higher availability, and more.
