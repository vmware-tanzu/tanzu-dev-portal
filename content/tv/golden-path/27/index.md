Is testing still a manual step for you? We have all been focused on CI/CD and overlooking automating QA in our path to prod. Integrated CI/CT/CD supply chains that are reusable and Kubernetes native remains a challenge.  

In this talk, we’ll unpack <a href='https://cartographer.sh/'>Cartographer</a>, a new OSS project, and explore how to create event-driven supply chains that not only create a reusable path to prod for CI/CD, but which has CT embedded in it as well. We’ll use Cartographer to create a templated approach to continuous testing.
