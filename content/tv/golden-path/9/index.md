Microservice architectures are all the rage in JavaLand. They allow teams to develop services independently and deploy autonomously.

Why microservices?

IF
  you’re developing a large/complex application
AND
  you need to deliver it rapidly, frequently, and reliably over a long period of time
THEN
  the Microservice architecture is often a good choice.

Reactive architectures are becoming increasingly popular for organizations that need to do more with less hardware. Reactive programming allows you to build systems that are resilient to high load.

In this session, I’ll show you how to use JHipster to create a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Keycloak, and run it all in Docker. You’ll leave with the know-how to create your own resilient apps!
