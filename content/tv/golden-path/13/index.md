You may be working for a fast-moving startup where it's ok to drop features whenever you want. But the odds are that you work for an organization that needs to plan for major deployments, rollouts, and releases. So how do you work toward the "Sooner Safer Happier" world within the constraints you have? 

This talk is an overview of how you can work WITH your compliance and security teams to address actual needs, instead of talking past each other about rules and processes. Join me if you'd like to hear more about progressive delivery, safety rollbacks, delivery testing, and release workflow management.
