Once we’re on the cloud, we continuously look for migrations and rearchitect to optimize cost and spending. These changes are really difficult and, with lots of unknowns, this makes migration really painful. Maintenance windows aren’t an option because testing happens in production. What if there were a way to migrate safely while mitigating risks and headaches?

In this session, we’ll be talking about the use of feature flags to avoid downtime as well as safely migrate between databases or new platforms like switching between cloud providers.
