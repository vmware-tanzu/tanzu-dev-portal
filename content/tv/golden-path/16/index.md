Customers are looking forward to getting a new feature in our application. Developers implemented it and pushed the changes to Git. How can we go from code commit to feature available in production on Kubernetes? How can we do that in a productive and secure way?

Following the continuous delivery principles, I’ll show how to design a paved path to production with a superior experience for developers while giving operators enough flexibility and control. Using Cartographer, we’ll choreograph our way from code commit to deployment on Kubernetes and build a complete CI/CD pipeline.

We’ll then monitor Git repositories with Flux, containerize applications with Cloud Native Buildpacks, run automated tests with Tekton, scan images with Trivy, configure workloads with Carvel, and deploy them with Knative.

The presentation focuses on open source technologies and includes a hands-on demo you can run in your Kubernetes environments and use as a foundation for your real-world supply chains.
