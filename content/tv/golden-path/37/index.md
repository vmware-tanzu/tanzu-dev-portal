Airbnb, Paypal, Netflix, and others are modernizing their microservices using GraphQL to tame the complexity of microservices at scale. By using GraphQL Stitching, calls to multiple microservices can be handled from a single GraphQL endpoint therefore simplifying and optimizing your microservice architecture. In this session, you will understand important differences between REST and GraphQL and how GraphQL Stitching using Lilo can simplify Spring GraphQL microservices. You will see two demos of Spring with Lilo and additionally learn how to improve observability with GraphQL using distributed tracing and instrumentation.
