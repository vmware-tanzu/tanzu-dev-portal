With modern applications spanning from edge to any and all clouds to support data collection, real-time streaming, sensor ingest, edge computing, IoT use cases and edge AI, we need to be able to run our Spring microservices anywhere. Apache Pulsar allows us to build computing at the edge and produce and consume messages at scale in any IoT, hybrid, or cloud environment. Apache Pulsar supports MoP, which allows for MQTT protocol to be used for high-speed messaging. I’ll live code, run, and deploy Spring-based Edge applications to Raspberry Pis and NVIDIA Jetson devices.

Spring is often forgotten in real-time data processing and replaced with Python or Scala.    

Spring belongs in your real-time data pipeline and I’ll show you how to incorporate it in streaming applications as part of a FLiP-Spring application. Pulsar, Flink, Spark, NiFi, and Spring work together very well to build fast, safe streaming applications to deploy in bare metal, VMs, containers, pods, VMware Tanzu, or any cloud.
