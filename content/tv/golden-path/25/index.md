Do you know why a lot of popular open source projects die? Their owners and maintainers just burn out. The number of issues is growing together with the number of users. But your resources are limited. One day you wake up and understand that you’ll never close all of these tickets. The situation looks hopeless. But it’s not.

In DBeaver, we have a small development team and more than 6 million users. We know this problem very well. In this talk, I’d like to share some tips on how to manage the vast issues flow, deliver products on time, and not go crazy. 

Even if you work for a big enterprise, your project challenges are not really different. Management always has limitations related to people, time, and money. Our experience is specific but can be easily applied to any project.
