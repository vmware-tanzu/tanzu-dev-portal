While Agile methods of conducting user research focus on efficiency and iterative products, this process overlooks the impact it has on end-users. 

In this talk, we will share our experience conducting user research with people who have experienced a traumatic event. We will share our learnings and the Trauma-Informed principles that ensured minimal cognitive effort on the part of the user, and reduced the risk of reliving traumatic experiences. By participating in this talk, the audience will walk away with an application of the Trauma-Informed framework and practices to leverage in their user research practices.
