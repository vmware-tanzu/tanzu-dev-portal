Years ago, when Northern Trust built desktop and mobile applications to support conversations between important clients and their advisors, it was seen as innovative. But since then, competitors have caught up, and clients’ expectations around these interactions have changed.

However, monolithic architecture and aging technologies made it difficult to adapt to this new landscape. Northern Trust knew it needed to rewrite its existing software and create a new, streamlined web application. But its existing consultancy firms couldn’t manage the transformation, and yet another consultancy wasn’t able to deliver a solution.

As the expression goes, “Third time’s a charm,” and Northern Trust finally found the winning formula for its modernization approach. In this session, Subbarao Mandavilli, senior vice president of wealth management, talks about the people, process, and technology changes that allowed Northern Trust to build the working software to meet business needs.
