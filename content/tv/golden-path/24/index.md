This talk will focus on how engineering teams can leverage automated refactoring originated at Netflix to greatly reduce the time and effort required to migrate to new versions of Spring and Spring Boot.

OpenRewrite is an open source ecosystem that specializes in mass, automated refactoring with a bench-strength in Java source code, Maven build files, XML, YAML, and property files. Weâ€™ll discuss the technology behind automated code migration, how the ecosystem delivers composable, prepackaged recipes that can be used to automate common framework migration, and how these recipes can be integrated into both Maven and Gradle builds.

This talk will include some live demonstrations of automated migrations on real-world Java applications and libraries.
