Java Records (a language feature finalized in Java 16) give us a language level technique to work with "carriers for immutable data". Though simple enough to describe initially, there are edges to avoid, tips to remember, and use cases to embrace. Knowing the details of how records are intended to be used can guide us towards safer and more readable code.

Weâ€™ll introduce Records and the motivation for adding them to the Java language, demonstrate some use cases in the context of the Spring Framework, and see if Records can change how we write our software!
