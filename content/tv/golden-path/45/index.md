Spring Cloud Functions enables you to write simple Java Functions that, combined with Spring Boot, can easily be realized in a serverless environment such as AWS Lambda. Implementing business logic as functions is a perfect fit for AWS Lambda's event-driven architecture. How to get the most from both of these technologies and its features? Are there any useful tricks? What about Spring Native and AOT?

In this session (50/50 presentation/demo), Oleg (Spring) and Mark (AWS) will discuss and demonstrate these features and enhancements with a single function handling 10,000 requests a second.
