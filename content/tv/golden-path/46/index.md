Creating new applications based on company standards is more challenging than it should be. Furthermore, incrementally adding new features to that project over time is even trickier, with developers often cutting and pasting code from various sources to solve the problem at hand.
 
In this talk, weâ€™ll take a demo-driven tour of a new CLI for Spring developers that will help accelerate your development by helping you create new projects and, more importantly, allowing you to add code to your existing project.
 
Code is added in two main ways. First, merging and refactoring code from an existing runnable project hosted in a version control repository into your current project. Second, create user-defined commands whose definitions live alongside your application code and use a template engine to generate code and configuration.
 
Projects and user-defined functions can also be curated into catalogs to help share best practices across teams and quickly evolve them over time.
