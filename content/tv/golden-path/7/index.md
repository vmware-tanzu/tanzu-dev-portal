Developer teams are constantly under pressure to deliver new features and functionality without impacting core applications. In this session, weâ€™ll show how to add new application features reliably and securely to Spring Boot applications without changing the core application or impacting core business activity.  Highlights will include employing feature flags, AB testing, and blue-green deployments using GitHub actions and GitHub repos, plus powerful cloud services based on serverless technologies, and managed container orchestration using Kubernetes.
