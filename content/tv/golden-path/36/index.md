Spring Data JDBC has recently been enhanced with improved writing strategies to offer long-awaited support for batch operations. These updates deliver significant performance improvements to nearly all write operations by minimizing the number of roundtrips to the database.

Whether you’re currently using the module or looking for a reason to try it out, come to hear all about these new enhancements. You’ll learn about the kinds of database operations that are batched, what it even means for them to be batched, the dialects that are supported, and what you need to do to start reaping the benefits on your projects.
