Cloud availability zones and regions are not immune to outages. The zones go down regularly and regions become unavailable during natural disasters or human-caused incidents. Thus, if an availability zone or a larger area goes down, so does your application—unless the application can work across multiple geographic locations.

Come and learn how to build resilient, geo-distributed Java apps that can withstand various cloud failures. Using Spring Cloud tools and components, we’ll architect and deploy a geo-distributed Slack-like messenger that can span several continents, load balance requests across distant regions, and most importantly, tolerate various storms and outages in the cloud.
