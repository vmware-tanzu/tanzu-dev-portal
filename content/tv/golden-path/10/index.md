When writing a new Spring web app, teams often have some nagging scaling doubts:
<ul>
<li>How many users can my app simultaneously handle?</li>
<li>How fast will my @RestControllers dash out those JSON responses?</li>
<li>How much memory, CPU, or I/O does my application need?</li> 
<li>How much money do I need to spend on hosting?</li>
</ul>
Surprisingly, there's very little advice out there on how to sensibly approach these questions in a practical wayâ€”apart from simply autoscaling random Kubernetes pods into oblivion. 
 
In this #almostnoslides session, we're going to use an IDE, a pen tablet, and a few libraries to get a deep, practical understanding of the following:
<ul>
<li>Throughput and latency: How to (reliably) find out how many users your Spring app can handle</li>
<li>CPU/memory/IO: How much (or how little) your app actually needs</li>
<li>Hosting: What server your app needs</li>
</ul>

By the end of this talk, you'll have learned solid load-testing processes and skills that make you never worry about scaling your Spring web apps again.
