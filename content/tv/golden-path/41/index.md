Your mission is to secure the vast tracts of land of the cloud native security landscape. Where do you even start?!? It would be preposterous to cover that whole topic in a single session, but we can at least map it out. Our plan is to break it down into three key areas and review each in turn.

- Platform: securing and upgrading our control planes and nodes; isolating compute, storage, and network resources; managing privileges and secrets
- User management and permissions: various ways to authenticate and authorize user access; leveraging tools like RBAC and Namespaces, and some common “gotchas”
- Software supply chain: what that means; some actual threat models are; how to mitigate them

You’ll leave this session with a stronger understanding of the breadth and depth of cloud native security and resources to further develop your knowledge.
