In the past year, Spring Cloud AWS has gone through a major refactoring, in many places even a complete rewrite: integration with modern AWS SDK v2 for Java, massive enhancements in S3 integration, including integration with high-throughput Transfer Manager, persistence with DynamoDB, over 10x faster SQS integration, local testing with Localstack, reduced startup time, and much more. 

In this session, we’ll go through new additions, improvements, and deprecations, as well as the motivation behind them. You’ll learn how simple it is to integrate Spring Boot applications with AWS services using Spring Cloud AWS 3.0.
