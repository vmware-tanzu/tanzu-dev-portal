Korifi is an open source project aimed at simplifying the Kubernetes experience for application developers. Internally, it uses several open source projects such as kpack, Envoy, Contour, Paketo, Eirini, etc., and makes it possible to use the familiar cf push command to deploy application to a Kubernetes backend. The small footprint of Korifi makes it ideal for local, edge, and cloud-based infrastructure, providing much-needed convergence. It takes Kubernetes' ability—to unify these infrastructure types—and elevates its capability by introducing the CF PaaS abstraction. It impacts local development, CI/CD, and works with all languages and frameworks (with Spring supported as a first-class citizen), making Korifi an ideal project for software engineering teams working with Kubernetes.
