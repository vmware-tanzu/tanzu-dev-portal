Do you want to use a microservices architecture? Are you looking for a solution to manage access to single services from clients? How can you ensure resilience and security for your entire system? Spring Cloud Gateway is a project based on Reactor, Spring WebFlux, and Spring Boot which provides an effective way to route traffic to your APIs and address cross-cutting concerns.

In this session, I’ll show you how to configure an API gateway to route traffic to your microservices and improve the resilience of your system with patterns like circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks, and rate limiters using Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker and Resilience4J. Since the gateway is the entry point of your system, it’s also an excellent candidate to address security concerns like user authentication. I’ll show you how to do that with Spring Security, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect. Finally, I’ll show you how to improve the observability of your system using Spring Boot Actuator, OpenTelemetry, and Grafana.
