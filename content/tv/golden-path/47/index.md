There are many ways that users can interact with an application, including keyboards, mice, and touch screens. But one newcomer to the UI arena—voice—offers a hands-free, natural option for users to speak to applications and hear responses spoken back. Indeed, conversational and ambient user interfaces offer unique opportunities that hands-on interfaces can't match.

Creating voice experiences for Spring applications is in many ways much the same as developing traditional user interfaces with popular JavaScript frameworks or desktop technologies. Even so, there are some specific factors that go into designing a voice interface for a Spring backend.

In this session, we’ll look at how to create a simple voice user interface for Alexa. We’ll then make it the voice of a Spring application, seeing how to design our APIs and implement security to support a voice frontend. Along the way, we’ll consider what makes a compelling voice experience for any application.
