Within Tanzu Labs, **we value work/life balance and sustainable pace of work.** There are many organizations in our industry where burn-out is just a fact of life, along with the associated high turnover. We're not one of them. We maintain a healthy work/life balance, not only for ourselves, but as a **role model for other companies.**
