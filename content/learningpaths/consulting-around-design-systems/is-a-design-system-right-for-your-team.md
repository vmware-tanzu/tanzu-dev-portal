## Common Challenges

> “No matter how hard you fight the darkness, every light casts a shadow…”  
> — Plato

Design systems are no exception to Plato’s insightful observation of this basic reality. For all the value there is to be gained by using them,  design systems do not come without some very real challenges. While some of these challenges are inherent, requiring vigilance and discipline to navigate, others are entirely avoidable. Let’s muse on some common challenges around design systems, and how  you can approach navigating them.


## Risky Business

There’s no getting around this one. Some big decisions around design systems are  difficult to walk back. Once you’ve decided to start using a system, it is almost always going to be a very expensive decision to unmake. 


### What you can do

It’s important that you do everything in your power to make good, well-informed decisions. Check out some of the sections below to help navigate these choices whether you’re [choosing a design system](#heading=h.d37dn5mmcyqr) or [inheriting one](#heading=h.dprmrsiz082i).


## Proficiency and Experience

Software folk come from all manner of backgrounds, so it’s not uncommon for you to be working with stakeholders, partners, or practitioners who have little to no experience working with design systems. 


### What you can do

Remember, empathy first. It’s no fun to not know something you feel like you should. Look for ways to help your team deepen their understanding of design systems, and remember to stay open to learning yourself. We work in an ever-changing industry, and “knowing” anything is always risky. Treat every team and every system like a new opportunity, and consider doing some [design-system-focused norming](#heading=h.4n5kqmvhy0ii) among product teams.


## Management and Maintenance

Managing and maintaining any kind of in-house system is a beast of a job. No matter how you slice it, there are a lot of plates to keep spinning: 



* What kind of resources are needed to build and maintain the system? 
* How often are updates made? How are they communicated? 
* How are contributions handled? How do teams get help or training? 
* How many tints and shades of blue do we need?

It’s possible that your experience working with a system did not go _smoothly_. It’s also possible that the folks who need help handling all this business are working outside the explicit boundaries of a specific project or team, making them a little more difficult to influence. 


### _What you can do_ 

Again, empathy first. Assume that everyone is doing their best and try to see where you may be able to offer some feedback, guidance, or influence. Consider disguising it as help if there are fragile egos in the mix. If there’s a meeting where updates to the system are discussed, ask if you can attend. If there’s a Slack channel where QandA takes place, join the conversation. 

In general, try to kindly identify gaps, inefficiencies, or problems where you see them, and always be sure to offer possible solutions if you have them. Designers are problem-solvers, after all.


## Supporting Resources

The availability of high-quality supporting resources for practitioners is another challenge with adapted or custom systems. . Issues exist from incomplete or contradictory documentation, to incorrect color values in the published design library. This can be frustrating as a practitioner, especially when it slows down the ability to do your work. These resources are often owned by outside teams, and perhaps sitting outside your sphere of influence.


### _What you can do_ 

If you find yourself working with resources owned by another team consider it an opportunity. If you notice that designers are constantly detaching the instances of a design component because it’s built incorrectly, point out to your teammates what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it. This is a good opportunity to demonstrate proactivity, as well. If you come across missing documentation or sloppy assets, find out what the process is for making fixes. In all likelihood, whoever has that in their job description is going to be glad to have some help. See if you can gently inject yourself and some of your expertise. If you can help improve these resources, you’ll not only be helping your team, but every other team who uses the system.


## Consistency

Consistency—the white whale. The idea of in-app and cross-app consistency is one riddled with nuance and strong opinions. You may run across leaders who insist on the consistent use of patterns regardless of domain. You may encounter a designer who believes they’ve revolutionized the dropdown, rejecting basic system components in favor of their own custom creations. You may discover that the teams building parts of a single large product offering have entirely different navigation patterns and applications of the color palette. And you will almost certainly run into someone with a desire for consistency, and an inability to tell you what that means.


### What you can do 

First,  remember that consistency does not mean uniformity. There is, and should be, room for autonomy. Second, try to suss out what “consistency” means in your particular situation. Think about what it might take to achieve, and determine the value that the consistency provides to the organization, users, practitioners, and product teams. 

Achieving the consistency that’s initially desired is a grossly underestimated effort that provides overestimated value. That’s not to say there is _no_ value to be gained. If inconsistencies in major design patterns are causing confusion and frustration for users, or if they are resulting in a sloppy look for an organization, something should be done about it. 

Should you encounter a similar issue it’s best to proceed with caution, and do what you can to:



* Facilitate a clear articulation of the desired outcomes.
* Measure the impact inconsistency is having on the users/teams/org.
    * Run quantitative or qualitative studies with users to get data on perceived brand consistency, pattern consistency/familiarity, etc.
    * Collect data on the frequency of inconsistent pattern usage or implementation.
    * Talk to teams to gauge the impact of inconsistency has on their velocity.
    * Talk to stakeholders to gain insight on perceived brand impact.
* Size-up the effort involved in achieving the desired outcomes.
    * Talk to all disciplines to understand what would be involved.
    * Run a small consistency experiment to help estimate timelines and effort.
* Balance all the info above and prioritize ruthlessly


## Attitudes

There is no shortage of spicy opinions to be found around design systems. There are designers who are upset by the feeling of their autonomy being taken away, and there are plenty of folks who are not the biggest fans of Material. Still, others are excited by the prospect of having to make fewer design decisions. It’s important  to allow people space to have their own emotions and opinions, but there is a point where attitudes can become unproductive, risky, or even toxic.


### What you can do 

Talk about attitudes that you encounter around design systems openly, and honestly with your team about handling attitudes around design systems. Try having a one-on-one, or sharing a different perspective with someone who may be harboring an attitude. From a practical perspective, try finding fun ways to [embrace creative constraints](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/slow-gains/201401/the-weird-strategy-dr-seuss-create-his-greatest-work). 

For example, we once ran a creative constraints workshop with a team of client designers who had mixed feelings (and mixed adoption) of their design system. It turned into a great bonding experience. We witnessed an emotional saga told exclusively with emojis,  that actually helped cool down some of the spicier attitudes on the team.


# Choosing a Design System

At Tanzu Labs, we love Lean and Agile because of the flexibility it affords us to iterate quickly and build valuable products. You know to identify and buy-down risk, understanding where you can afford to make assumptions and where you cannot. Unfortunately, there are risks associated with design systems that far too often go unnoticed or underestimated leading to costly mistakes. Bouncing back from a poorly-made design system choice can feel like you’re trying to stir the cream back out of your coffee. 

There are ways to avoid making bad decisions. If you or your team is in the position to choose***** the design system you use (or whether you use one at all),  there are plenty of things to do to buy down your risk and feel confident in the decisions you’re about to make. Rallying as a balanced team to ask the right questions about yourselves, and your product can make all the difference. 

_*If you’re in a position where these decisions have been made or will be made for you, we gotchu! Mosey on down to these pointers around [Inheriting a Design System](#heading=h.dprmrsiz082i)_


## Learn About Your Team

Early in your engagement, try to have a session with your team that allows you to gauge your team members’ comfort-level with design systems, without making anyone feel bad. Some goals of a session like this could be:



* **Start building shared ownership** with the understanding that design systems are not a “design thing”—they’re a balanced team thing. 
* Gauge your team members’ experience and familiarity with design systems as a whole.
* Gauge your team members’ experience and familiarity with a _specific _design system that you might be using.
* Discuss potentially [confusing terminology](#heading=h.z4rp9g4nvq19) in the design system space and start to align on ubiquitous language (if doing so makes sense for your team).
* Set expectations and build relationships that allow lean negotiations to take place around design/features/UI.

The following are suggestions for prompts and questions to help get the conversation started:



* What are the enablement goals for the engagement (specifically, any around front-end or design systems)?
* How front-end-friendly is the group?
* Who’s worked with design systems before? What systems has everyone worked with?
* What do you love/hate about design systems?
* What has your design/dev handoff experience been like in the past?
* What kind of learning and enablement goals (if any) do team members have around design systems?
* What are some team agreements that should be discussed?


## Learn About Your Product Needs

Also early in your engagement, make sure your discovery covers learning about some of the needs of your product and of the ecosystem in which it will live. Having answers to these questions is immensely helpful in weighing your design system options. Some important things to find out:



* Who is the audience for your app?
* What amount of style customization will you need?
* What are the delivery goals for the engagement (i.e. time constraints)?
* Are you subject to any specific technical limitations or constraints? What are they?
* What will the ROI be for using a system?
* How much can you afford to invest (time, resources) in implementing customization?
* What are our goals or requirements in terms of accessibility? 
* What browser/device compatibility do we need to provide?
* Is your product part of a portfolio of apps? Is it planning to be in the future?


## Consider Options and Trade-offs

Once you’ve had discussions within your team and learned as much as you can about the needs for your product, you’ll want to examine your options and make the choice that’s best for your unique situation. Since the decisions around design system approaches can be costly to walk back, it's very helpful to understand the trade-offs before deciding.

**Adopting a system  
_What we mean_** 

Fully adopting an existing open-source system and staying largely (or entirely) within the lanes it provides. For example: [Google Material](https://material.io/design/introduction), [IBM Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/), [VMware Clarity](https://clarity.design/) or [Microsoft Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/).


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>  Pros</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>  Cons</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Low cost.

<li>Shortcut to polish/fidelity.

<li>Vetted patterns and interactions.

<li>Can make things like responsive behavior more attainable.

<li>More likely to find familiarity among designers and developers.

<li>Usually include some ability to customize colors and fonts.

<li>Good systems have invested in accessibility and browser compatibility, which you will get for free.

<li>You get bug fixes and updates for free.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Low brand differentiation.

<li>Less customization.

<li>Made for everyone, and for no one.

<li>Like or fight the template.

<li>More consumer-leaning patterns.

<li>Sheer number of options can create challenges in consistency (especially for portfolios).

<li>Tethered to the maintainers of the system—no input in direction.

<li>Difficult decision to walk back from.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Adapting a System  
_What we mean_** 

Starting with an open-source system as a foundation, but building custom translation layers for things like themes or domain-specific components. For example: KesselRun UI (KRUI), which is a set of branded themes built on a [Material UI](https://mui.com/') foundation.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>  Pros</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>  Cons</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Provides a <em>little</em> more customization and differentiation than straight adopting.

<li>Lower-cost than a custom system.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Higher cost than adopting a system.

<li>Adds a translation layer to build, learn and maintain.

<li>Requires <em>some</em> resources to manage and maintain (maybe not dedicated).
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Creating a System  
_What we mean_**

Taking the DIY option and creating a custom system entirely from scratch. From color choices to browser compatibility, type scale to responsive grids, design assets, coded components, and contribution and maintenance processes. Everything according to your needs and vision. 


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>  Pros</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>  Cons</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Full customization.

<li>High brand differentiation.

<li>Long-term gain of replication at scale.

<li>Full control over choices, processes, direction and maintenance.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Likely requires a dedicated team.

<li>Takes time to get going.

<li><strong>You don’t get <em>anything</em> for free.</strong>

<li><strong>High cost (possibly <em>extremely </em>high).</strong>

<li>Requires creation of documentation. and training materials.

<li>Difficult decision to walk back from.
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>




**Skipping a system (or growing one slowly)**

_What we mean_

Taking the option to skip a design system entirely or to let one evolve from an organic need. Maybe a key stakeholder loves the Craigslist look and you can meet their needs without any fancy UI. More likely than the Craigslist lover, you might have a young portfolio of apps who choose to start with only common styles—as they grow together, they can then identify valuable places for consistency and create a shared library of common components over time, if doing so would provide needed value.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>  Pros</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>  Cons</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Cheaper than starting off with a design system

<li>Creates a unique learning opportunity for practitioners

<li>Provides a way to test components that might later become a system

<li>Benefit of customization without cost of a dedicated team

<li>Can be speedy
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Scaling is not trivial

<li>Limited by the skills of the team

<li>Risky (can be short-sighted)

<li>Difficult decision to walk back from
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



> This is worth repeating: **not everyone needs a design system**. With their current surging popularity, this can be a difficult idea to sell. If you think a design system might not be the right choice, consider starting with something lightweight like a style guide paired with a basic process for sharing reusable patterns, and then pulling the design system lever when (and if) you’re confident that you’ve hit the value-add tipping point.

# Inheriting a design system

Oddly enough, the relationship we find ourselves in with design systems can make it feel almost like a family member: we interact with it constantly, we get to know its strengths and quirks, and once it’s there, we’re mostly stuck with it. Occasionally, we do get to choose members of our family like our spouse, but there’s a good bit of family that we don’t get to choose—plenty of us inherit a pile of in-laws upon marriage, and I don’t know about you, but I had very little input into my parents’ decision to have my brother and sister. 

If you are inheriting a design system, either by joining an established team who already has one in place, or by being in a position where the choice is not up to your team, you probably won’t have a lot of control over the system itself. Even if that’s the case, there are still some things that are important to discuss and understand, and it's worth it for your team (not just your designers) to take the time to understand the landscape you’re entering into, so that you can navigate it gracefully and effectively.


## Meet people where they’re at

Always remember to meet people where they’re at. If you encounter an immature or incomplete design system, or an incomplete understanding of the system being adopted, try to help teams and individuals grow their understanding and/or their system by helping identify and address gaps or problem areas. Don’t just complain or tell people they’re doing a lousy job with the system—this helps no one.


## Get familiar with the landscape

Seek to understand as much as you can about the current ecosystem, and keep an eye out for opportunities either to reinforce something that’s being done well, or to identify something that could be done better. We know this is just another bullet list in a not-exactly-short document, but we cannot overemphasize the importance of channeling your inner truffle pig, and sniffing out as many of these things as possible



* What’s the culture like at the organization? 
* How did they arrive at their current system? How long have they been using it? 
    * Is it adopted, adapted, or custom?
* Is the system complete and in maintenance mode?
    * Is there an opportunity to influence upcoming changes or additions?
* Is the system still being built out?
    * If the system is half-baked, are there areas where you could influence?
    * _We have spent serious time here and have some additional thoughts below******_
* Who manages the design system? 
    * Do they have processes in place to handle contributions and feedback? 
    * How are updates and/or breaking changes communicated?
    * Are they in the market for some new friends?
* How many teams use the system, and how do they typically collaborate?
    * Interview existing teams to learn about their experiences
    * Interview existing teams to learn about benefits and limitations of the system
* What training resources exist? (documentation, classes, cross-pairing, etc)
* How “good” are the designer assets (i.e. figma library)? 
    * If they’re less-than-ideal, could you offer your fancy-shmancy help?

_**If you find yourself inheriting a half-baked client system, see if there are places you might gently inject yourself and some of your expertise while the bun is still in the oven. In our experience, there are often places where design system teams can benefit from collaboration, guidance, and influence, but these opportunities won’t be gift-wrapped—you will have to seek them out and build relationships in order to have a positive influence.**_


## Get into the weeds

If products have already been built using the system, get to know them



* Attend design crits or product demos
* Study how components are used for standard interaction patterns
* Read product training materials if they exist

Circle back to the interviewing of current teams. You’ll probably dig up some good dirt. Liiiiike:



* Tips and tricks
* Lessons learned
* Naming conventions across the system, and potential inconsistencies to be aware of
* Non-accessible color combinations to be aware of
* Bugs and/or omissions
* Multiple versions of things
* Contact info for system maintainers (it’s all who you know)
