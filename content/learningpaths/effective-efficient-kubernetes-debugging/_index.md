## Why is this learning path important?
One of the most commonly needed and important skills in the world of Kubernetes
is how does one approach debugging of issues on the Platform.  While much easier 
said than done in practice, the first step is to know what is the exact problem 
before solutioning and not to overthink it.  However, how does one efficiently 
and effectively do this? This learning path aims to enable a reader with skills 
to help with debugging Kubernetes platform issues through finding the source 
problems first effectively and efficiently.  


## Who is this learning path for?

This learning path is for platform engineers, software engineers and architects 
who wish to learn debugging and problem solving techniques on Kubernetes.  It is
assumed that the reader is comfortable with Linux, is familiar with running 
`kubectl` commands and basic understanding of the deployment lifecycle of 
applications on Kubernetes. 

## Learning outcomes

After completing this learning path, you will know
- The recommended debugging flow and techniques.
- The top 6 common classes of problems encountered in practice and how you can 
  use these as heuristics to help you narrow down causes of issues.
- Hypothesizing and performing validating tests with context test debugging.
- Using the Dump In, Sink Out method for group based problem solving for larger
  and complex problems.
