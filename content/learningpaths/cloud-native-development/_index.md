## Why is this learning path important?

This learning path provides you with foundational knowledge around modern, cloud native software development with Spring and Tanzu Application Service (TAS).

You'll get the most out of this learning path if you have an application-related software development project with Tanzu Labs. However, it's also a highly effective learning path without a service engagement.

## Who is this learning path for?
 
This learning path is for software engineers and architects interested in quickly ramping up their cloud native skills with Spring Boot. 

## What will you learn in this learning plan?
 
You'll learn essential cloud native software development skills using Spring Boot and the Tanzu Application Service. You'll also be given a list of specific and targeted links to assist you in this learning path.

Each section is followed by suggested homework assignments and additional resources. This learning path takes approximately eight hours to complete, but the more time you spend on the learning path, for example, doing a deep study on the additional resources provided, the more value you'll get out of it.
