> MASTER FACILITATOR AND COACH; CAN STEP UP OR STEP BACK AS NEEDED.

{{% callout %}}
A skillful leader does not make decisions in a vacuum; they make space for the team to make decisions as a group.

Many Tanzu Labs engineers feel that anchors are responsible for assessing what needs to be done — from an engineering perspective — and making sure those tasks get done through skillful facilitation and delegation. The trick here is providing enough leadership to move the team forward without taking control of the decision-making process. Much like [the Peer](/learningpaths/anchor-playbook/the-peer), it may be unclear to outsiders who the anchor (servant leader) actually is.

## Responsibilities
- Bring the team to a higher level of situational awareness
- Facilitate conversations, especially through activities
- Keep the team moving forward
- Model values and norms for the team to imitate
- Make sure everyone has a voice in decision-making

## Considerations
- A servant leader opens up the team for more diversity and safety for experimentation
- Even while growing, the team needs to be held to a standard of excellence

## Challenges
- Anchors may put unreasonable expectations on themselves and feel alone and stressed
- Anchors with many other responsibilities have little time to pair and code
