> USES STRONG KNOW-HOW TO BUILD TRUST WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND TEAMMATES

{{% callout %}}
The anchor can help build trust by being the first — but not the only — Engineer to jump in and demonstrate technical skill and good judgement.
{{% /callout %}}

The "consulting experience" and technical chops of this anchor often catches the eye of project stakeholders. The Expert often becomes the point of contact for  stakeholders as well as a hub of knowledge for other members of the team. It is typically expected that a skilled anchor will find opportunities to redirect questions and raise up their team members as fellow experts.

### Responsibilities
- Draw upon deep/broad technical experience when team is making decisions
- Readily admit when they don’t know, and find out whom does
- Identify opportunities for valuable team learning
- Collaborate skillfully with other disciplines
- Surface the tradeoffs of architectural decisions
- Clearly communicate our approach and generate shared understanding

### Considerations
- Must use influence wisely
- Stakeholders tend to view the anchor as the responsible point of contact
- Strong consulting skills from the anchor earn goodwill from stakeholders
- While making the teams trust-worthy, Anchors teach stakeholders how to trust their own teams
- There is a minimum ramp-up period for new anchors regardless of expertise

### Challenges
- Anchors can take on a significant emotional burden of making sure decisions are right
- Anchors that take on this role raise expectations similar to those of a tech lead
- It is an unreasonable expectation for an engineer to be the Expert for all the projects they anchor
- Implicit and gender and other biases can determine the success an anchor has in this role, regardless of their skill
