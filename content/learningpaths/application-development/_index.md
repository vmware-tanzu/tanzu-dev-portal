## Why is this important?
 
Software engineering techniques have never evolved at such a rapid pace as they are today. New frameworks, practices, and technologies keep emerging, while bringing new concepts and increased complexity of software. As a result, it feels hard to keep up with change and to make the right choices for your end-to-end modern application lifecycle.
 
Beyond technology, this learning path also teaches the fundamentals of the 30+ year old [VMware Tanzu Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs) methodology on developing modern applications, including how to:
 
- Build the right thing the first time.
- Use Agile development to deliver the products your customers want.
- Seed a new mindset. Quickly validate your concepts. Get them from idea to production in days, and not months.
 
## Who is this learning path for?
 
This learning path is primarily for software engineers and other technical development team members involved in the development of modern applications. 
 
Managers, designers, and other non-technical stakeholders may also find this learning path useful for understanding new technical terminology and concepts. 

This learning path is also an adequate, on-the-clock preparation for getting the most out of an on-site or remote Tanzu Labs consulting engagement.
