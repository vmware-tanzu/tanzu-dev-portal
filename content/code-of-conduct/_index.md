# VMware Code of Conduct

### The VMware Principle of Respect

At VMware, every person is entitled to a respectful business environment, which means being treated honestly and professionally, and being valued for who you are and for your unique talents, background and perspectives. Our events and conferences are no different…our attendees, partners, customers, and employees collaborate with each other across offices, time zones, cultures, and countries. It is vital that people embrace and promote each other’s differences and treat one another with the dignity and respect that each of us deserve. VMware expects our attendees, partners, customers, and employees to help promote a safe and respectful business environment that is free from all forms of discrimination, bullying, and harassment.

### Global Company and Our Global Standard

<p>We adhere to applicable laws regarding discrimination, harassment and bullying to ensure the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and a respectful business environment globally. We do not tolerate behavior that is unprofessional, disrespectful, or inappropriate, or which discriminates, harasses, bullies, or retaliates against attendees, partners, customers, or employees. In addition, we will not promote or tolerate any sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumers or otherwise create a sexualized environment at any VMware event or conference.</p>
<p>We expect decisions at our events and conferences to be made on the basis of neutral factors, and not on the basis of any protected individual characteristic, such as race, color, religion, citizenship, political activity or affiliation, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, veteran status, military status, sexual orientation (the gender(s) to whom one is attracted), sex and gender, including gender expression (the gender one presents to others), gender identity (how one identifies their gender, which can be different than the sex assigned at birth), pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and related medical conditions, and any other characteristics protected under applicable law and/or regulations.</p>
<p>Harassing conduct can range from extreme forms such as threats, violence or physical touching to less obvious actions like teasing, ridicule, ignoring or bothering others. Harassment interferes with a person’s participation or can create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. VMware expects attendees, partners, customers, and employees to conduct themselves in a manner that is courteous, professional and appropriate. We do not tolerate conduct that discriminates against or harasses anyone doing business with, sponsoring, attending or working for VMware. Harassment includes but is not limited to in person or online harassment—also known as “cyber harassment.”</p>
<p>If we find that an attendee, partner, customer, or employee has violated the terms of this policy, appropriate action will be taken, including but not limited to removal from the event and exclusion from future VMware events and conferences.</p>
