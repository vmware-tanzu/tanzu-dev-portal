During this workshop you will learn the finer details of how to create, build, run, and debug a basic Spring Boot app on
Kubernetes by doing the following:

- Create a basic Spring Boot app
- Build a Docker image for the app
- Push the image to a Docker registry
- Deploy and run the app on Kubernetes
- Test the app using port-forwarding and ingress
- Use skaffold to iterate easily as you work on your app
- Use kustomize to manage configurations across environments
- Externalize application configuration using ConfigMaps
- Use service discovery for app-to-app communication
- Deploy the Spring PetClinic App with MySQL
