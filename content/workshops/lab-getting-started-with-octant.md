Octant is an open source, developer-centric web interface for Kubernetes that lets you inspect a Kubernetes cluster and its applications. It provides an alternative to the de facto Kubernetes dashboard typically available with a Kubernetes cluster. Whereas the Kubernetes dashboard would be hosted in the cluster, Octant is deployed to your own local desktop machine. Octant works with your local Kubernetes client configuration, meaning you can use it with whatever Kubernetes cluster youâ€™re working with.
