title: Configuring a Cloud Native Application
topics: null

This is a workshop for developers and application operators
new to cloud native concepts who wish to learn the basics of
handling environmental configuration separately from a web application
codebase using modern orchestration platform tools.

After completing the workshop, you will be able to:

-   Explain configuration requirements of Cloud Native applications

-   Explain configuration options available to Cloud Native applications

-   Explain the concept of *Configuration Drift*,
    why it can be a problem,
    and how to avoid it.

This workshop is the second in a series of workshops that explore
cloud-native development and application operations practices.

The workshop also provides foundational background for other Tanzu
Developer Center Spring, Spring Boot or Kubernetes content.
