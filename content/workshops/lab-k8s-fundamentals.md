This workshop is intended to give you a quick, hands-on introduction to using Kubernetes. In the process, you’ll learn about some of the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes when deploying applications to it. The focus will be on what a developer would need to know to use the platform. It’s not a workshop on how to run the Kubernetes platform.
