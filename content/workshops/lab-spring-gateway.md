This workshop walks you through getting started with the Spring Cloud Gateway. The Spring Cloud Gateway is a library for building an API Gateway on top of Spring MVC. Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency.
