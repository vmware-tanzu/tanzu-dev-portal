This is a workshop for developers and application operators
new to cloud native concepts who wish to learn the basics of
building and deploying a web application to a container
orchestration platform.

In this workshop you will be presented:

- The essence of _Cloud Native_ in a modern technology
  and practices context

- Why _Cloud Native_ practices are important to you,
  your employers and your customers

You will also:

- Build a simple blocking web application.

- Containerize it for running on a container orchestration platform.

- Deploy the application to a container orchestration platform.

- Access your application in the public internet as an end-user.

- Monitor the state of your application on the platform.

This workshop is the first in a series of workshops that explore
cloud-native development and application operations practices.

The workshop also provides foundational background for other Tanzu
Developer Center Spring, Spring Boot or Kubernetes content.
