In this workshop, you'll explore how the Tanzu Build Service can produce OCI Compliant container images from source code in a repeatable, scalable, and secure manner. You'll start with a sample application, use the Tanzu Build Service to build a container, deploy it, update the application, and finally, patch the base operating system. In the process of the workshop, you'll use Harbor to look at the container image that Harbor produced.
