Tanzu Community Edition enables the creation of modern application platforms. These platforms can be created on local laptops or various clouds/Infrastructure Environments. A platform deployed using Tanzu Community Edition provides a Kubernetes runtime, tooling and additional repository of packages that can be installed/updated very easily. This workshop will focus on packages that can be installed using Tanzu Community Edition such as Cert-Manager, Knative, Prometheus, Grafana, etc. A package deployed using Tanzu Community Edition creates equivalent objects in the Kubernetes cluster, like Deployments, Services, Persistent Volumes, etc., when applicable.
