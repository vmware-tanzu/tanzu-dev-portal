Spring is the most popular Java framework for enterprise deployment. The choice of database can be easily configured, but usually it’s centered around traditional RDBMS systems. Traditional business apps have static data and are accessed by a single party, but not multiparty, which is needed to support passing of data between parties in a business workflow. The solution is to adopt Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), giving multiple parties a single source of truth—eliminating errors in transferring data and providing real-time data with enterprise security and privacy. In this session, we’ll give a high-level overview of how Spring and Blockchain DLT can be used in a digital asset exchange.
