Software Engineer interested in building products people love in agile environments with a focus on high-quality tests and clean code. At the moment, I am part of the Spring Engineering team at VMware working from Seville, Spain on a fully remote team. We are building Spring Cloud related products and frameworks to help people adopting a microservices architecture and improving the experience of Spring in Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. I like to focus on Reliability, Continuous Delivery, and Testing tasks and I mainly commit to Java Open Source projects.
