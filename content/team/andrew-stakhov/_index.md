I tend to describe myself as .NET geek. I love exploring every nook and cranny of .NET ecosystem, and how it compliments other technologies. As an experienced solutions architect, these days I focus mostly on enabling other developers by bringing over 20 years of building applications of varying complexity to bring a sobering perspective on coding best practices. One of my favorite topics is teaching other developers how to get best coding productivity by applying technology wisely without chasing shiny new things for no benefit. I spend a lot of my spare time working on improving .NET libraries that I maintain such as NMica or contributing to large open source ones such as Steeltoe, YARP and Kubernetes. When I’m not coding I reach for the sky – quite literally. As an avid aviation enthusiast, you’ll often find me up in the air flying my hang glider.
