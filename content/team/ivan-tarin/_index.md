He also writes guides, blogs, and videos for VMware and the open-source community. Currently, he is learning Kubernetes, container technologies, developer and cloud platforms, and application performance monitoring. For fun, Ivan sometimes looks into ML, mobile apps, and scripting. He lives in Colorado and loves music, art, nature, and of course his family and dog. If you want to reach him, give him a shout out on Twitter [@IvanTarin2](https://twitter.com/IvanTarin2).
