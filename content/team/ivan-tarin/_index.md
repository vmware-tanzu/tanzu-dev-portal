Ivan has been in the tech industry for a couple of years, having previously worked as a developer and now as an associate product marketing manager, which sees him using demos at conferences to teach technologies to users with varying levels of skill . He also writes guides, authors blogs, and produces videos for VMware and the open source community. Currently, he is learning Kubernetes, container technologies, developer and cloud platforms, and application performance monitoring. For fun, Ivan sometimes looks into ML, mobile apps, and scripting. He lives in Colorado and loves music, art, nature, and of course his family and his dog. If you want to reach him, give him a shout-out on Twitter [@IvanTarin2](https://twitter.com/IvanTarin2).
