Paul Czarkowski is a long-time practitioner of the dark arts of DevOps. Hailing from Australia, he moved to Austin,Texas to help build and run one of the largest and most successful online games. Now at VMware, Paul works to improve the operator experience by taking cloud native software development concepts and applying them to operations to create platforms that reduce toil and improve software delivery.

## What Can He Do For You ?

Paul can speak or host workshops on the following topics, both from VMware product and open source/community perspectives:

- Kubernetes
- Helm
- DevOps
- Containers
- Harbor
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Pretty much anything else Kubernetes/DevOps-related

## Highlights

#### Cloud Native Operations with Kubernetes

Paul will talk through how Kubernetes enables a new, cloud native way of operating software---part DevOps, part SRE, and all awesome! As Paul introduces the audience to the concepts of cloud native operations, he will put it to action,  building out a cloud native CI/CD stack and showing how to deploy and upgrade an application from source all the way to production on Kubernetes.

#### Hacking Helm

Helm is the best way to build, package, and run Kubernetes manifests. However, it has been considered by some as a fairly insecure way to deploy software, mostly due to its server component, Tiller. Let’s put that to the test and hack (and then protect from those hacks) Helm.
