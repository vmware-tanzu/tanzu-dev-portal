Lian always wanted to save the world.

After a failed attempt at becoming a lawyer, she decided to do something with computers instead. Working as a full stack software engineer, she got into attending tech events and giving talks on machine learning. During this time, she fell in love with the tech community and discovered her passion for building community and providing a safe and productive environment for all. This experience led to her co-organizing the community conference ServerlessDays Amsterdam.

Currently, Lian lives in Amsterdam and works as Developer Advocate at [Loft Labs](https://loft.sh/), helping to make developing on Kubernetes easy and fun.
