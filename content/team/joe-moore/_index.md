With a history at VMware Tanzu Labs reaching back to 2005, Joe is a passionate software engineer and Agile (XP!) practitioner with a mission to help others achieve amazing outcomes though software. Sometimes that means remote pair programming with clients and test-driving software with them (virtually) side-by-side. Sometimes that means publishing or helping others publish helpful content to this very site.

When he's not slinging code and prose, Joe is playing music, collecting guitars, petting cats, and spending as much time as possible with his incredible wife.
