Whitney traveled the scenic route but is chuffed to have found her way to Kubernetes 
and cloud technologies. Whitney began her professional career as a 
[fine artist](images/whitney-artist.jpg) before owning her own
[photography](images/whitney-photographer1.jpg) [business](images/whitney-photographer2.jpg) 
for over a decade. After a year-long tour [playing keys](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F4TFVwHJANE) 
in the band Mutual Benefit, Whitney went back to school in 2019 to learn full-stack web 
development. After graduation, Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of 
the skills she had just learned. She developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, 
and a passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. Whitney has made many 
cloud-related [lightboard videos](https://youtu.be/BgrQ16r84pM) that together have 400,000+ views.
At VMware, you can find Whitney writing lighthearted yet informative 
[guides](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/guides/knative-serving-wi/?utm_source=whitney&utm_campaign=devrel), or behind the 
lightboard during her weekly streaming show [ϟ Enlightning](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/tv/enlightning/?utm_source=whitney&utm_campaign=devrel).  Whitney’s contagious excitement 
drives her to collaborate and play!
