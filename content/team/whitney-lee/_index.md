Whitney traveled the scenic route but is absolutely chuffed to have found her way to Kubernetes and cloud technologies. She began her professional career as a [fine artist](/images/team/advocates/whitney-color/whitney-artist.jpg) before owning her own [photography](/images/team/advocates/whitney-color/whitney-photographer1.jpg) [business](/images/team/advocates/whitney-color/whitney-photographer2.jpg) for over a decade. Then, after a year-long tour [playing keys](/images/team/advocates/whitney-color/whitney-musician1.jpg) and [singing harmonies](/images/team/advocates/whitney-color/whitney-musician2.jpg) in the band [Mutual Benefit](https://mutualbenefit.bandcamp.com/), Whitney went back to school to learn full-stack web development. Shortly after graduation Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of the skills she had just learned at school. However Whitney quickly developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, and a passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. She has made many light board videos for IBM Cloud, from topics ranging from creating a [Pod in Kubernetes](https://youtu.be/BgrQ16r84pM), to [event-driven architecture](https://youtu.be/o2HJCGcYwoU), to cloud-native [API solutions](https://youtu.be/sKfep-UmZeM). At VMware Whitney's contagious excitement drives her to continue to explore, collaborate, teach, and play!
