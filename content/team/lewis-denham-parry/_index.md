Lewis works for [Control Plane](https://control-plane.io/) as the Head of Training, orchestrating the ocean of containers with Kubernetes whilst defending them from piratical attacks (which is usually from himself).

He co-founded [Cloud Native Wales](https://cloudnativewales.io/), an initiative 
to help people learn Cloud Native technologies and establish a community to support each other. 
When he's not playing with tech, he's busy trying to understand his children, trying to find a comfy chair to read a book or trying to find some snow to ski on.
