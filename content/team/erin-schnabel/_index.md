[Erin Schnabel](https://twitter.com/ebullientworks) is a Distinguished Engineer and maker of things
at Red Hat. She is a Java Champion, with over 25 years under her belt as a developer, technical 
leader, architect and advocate, and she strongly prefers being up to her elbows in code. Erin 
learns (and teaches) by coding ridiculous things, like 
[Monster Combat](https://github.com/ebullient/monster-combat), an application that makes monsters 
fight each other to explore application metrics; and 
[Game On! Text Adventure](https://gameontext.org) for exploring cloud native development.
