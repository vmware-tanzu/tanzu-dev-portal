Christian Wimmer is the architect of GraalVM Native Image. He was one of the first engineers of the GraalVM project, and helped it grow from a research project of Oracle Labs to a supported Oracle product. He believes that all languages should be equally fast, and that we therefore need to stop writing individual VMs and instead have one polyglot VM. His research interests span from compilers, virtual machines, and secure systems to component-based software architectures.
