Nick has been working to prevent the entropic downfall of systems for 25 years, across Windows and Linux, datacenters and clouds, networking, storage and compute. Currently he’s a Staff Engineer at Isovalent, and a maintainer on the Kubernetes [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) project, where in addition to his primary task of always having Simpsons quotes available, he works on improving the ingress and mesh experiences. He was a co-chair of the previous iteration of the Kubernetes LTS working group. In his spare time, he spends time with his young family, then with whatever’s left he works on maintaining his jack-of-all-geeks card. Random fact: he took notes at university in the Tengwar, Tolkien’s elvish script.
