Angela Chin is a Senior Engineer at VMware, working on Tanzu Application Service (for both VMs and Kubernetes!).

She has worked on the project in one form or another for the past 4 years and is an active contributor to the Cloud Foundry Foundation. Since COVID-19 has given her ample free time, she has taken up baking and long runs to balance each other out.
