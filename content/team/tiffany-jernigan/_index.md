#### Make Your Kubernetes Clusters Production-Ready with VMware Tanzu
When you first started experimenting with Kubernetes, you may have started locally or on a set of servers. With simple applications, you may only have used a container registry and Kubernetes itself. When looking to move your clusters to a production setting, there are many more considerations, such as: How will I manage my clusters? How do I handle monitoring and logging? How do I safely back up my cluster resources? How do I ensure that my container images are safe and secure?

Let’s take a look at some production-ready solutions, such as VMware Tanzu Mission Control (TMC), VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, Octant, Velero, and Harbor.

#### Intro to Kubernetes
If you’re working with just a few containers, managing them is not too complicated. But what if you have hundreds or thousands? Think about having to handle multiple upgrades for each container, keeping track of container and node state, available resources, and more. That’s where Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes is an open source container management platform that helps you run containers at scale. This talk will cover Kubernetes components and show how to run applications on it.
