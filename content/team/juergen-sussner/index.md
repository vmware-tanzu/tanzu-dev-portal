If you would write DevOps with a dash, I am the dash ...I am a JavaEE Developer, J2EE AppServer Admin, and Senior Cloud Platform Engineer at DATEV's Cloud Platform Team. We architect the platform necessary for DATEV’s future applications and implement many important extensions for Cloud Foundry to integrate it very well into DATEV’s environment. The platform is our Product and we, as a team are responsible for every aspect of the product, from technical issues to market research, requirements engineering and marketing. The terms "platform as a product" and "developer productivity" are not only my job, they are my passion. 2019 Founding Member of the Tanzu Vanguards and elected mayor.
