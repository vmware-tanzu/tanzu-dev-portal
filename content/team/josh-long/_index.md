[Josh (@starbuxman)](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) became the first Spring Developer Advocate in 2010 and hasn't looked back! He contributes (bugs, mostly..) to _numerous_ open source projects, including Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

<!--more-->

## What Can He Do For You?

Josh has a variety of talks and workshops on the following topics:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Architecture
- Microservices
- Full Stack Java Development
- GraphQL 
- Enterprise Application Integration 
- Workflow 
- Spring Data
- ..and countless other ecosystem libraries

He is a world-renowned speaker who has spoken on every continent except Antarctica at thousands of events, shows, and organizations. 

## _Spring Tips_ 

Josh puts together a weekly series on YouTube, [_Spring Tips_](https://bit.ly/spring-tips-playlist), where he explores the latest-and-greatest in the wide and wonderful world of Springdom 

## Books

Josh has authored a [half dozen books on Spring](https://joshlong.com/#books), and some of them, like [_Reactive Spring_](https://reactivespring.io) are not terrible! 

## This Week in Spring 

Josh has put out an installment of _This Week in Spring_ over [on the Spring blog](https://spring.io/blog) every Tuesday - without fail, since the first week of January 2010! -  that (attempts, and often fails to) round up the latest and greatest in the wonderful and wide world of Springdom. 

## _A Bootiful Podcast_

Josh is the host of a podcast called [_A Bootiful Podcast_](https://bootifulpodcast.fm) whose new episodes drop every Friday (roughly). In it, he sits down and talks to people that are smarter than he is (a shallow bar!) about  the Spring and adjacent ecosystems. 

## Livelessons 

Josh has done longer-form training courses - seen by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide - [on the Livelessons platform](https://joshlong.com/livelessons.html) since 2013.

## Abstracts

### Cloud Native Java (5-10 Days)

<p>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming</p>
<p>Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.</p>
<p>But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java applications. A cloud native application is:</p>
<ul><li>elastic</li>
<li>agile</li>
<li>observable</li>
<li>robust</li></ul>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is designed to fully exploit a cloud platform both in the application layer - where things decompose into microservices - and at the data layer where NoSQL offers better horizontal scaling and fitness for specific purpose. This is what we mean by <em>elastic</em>.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>agile</em>. It should be easy to write, change, test, deploy and operate. If the cost of change is prohibitive then normal people under normal situations won't do it. We must make doing the right thing - that which supports change - the easy thing.</p>
<p>A cloud native system is <em>observable</em>. It must support at-a-glance insight into what is happening in the system and support remediation. It must be instrumented at the application and systems levels to support the effort of crisis-management.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>fault tolerant</em>, or <em>robust</em>. If a service should fail, the system must be able to recover and degrade gracefully. Instead of trying to build a system that is predicated on the lie that things are highly available, build instead to optimize for time to remediation.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll cover:</p>
<ul><li><p><em>Basics</em> - we'll look at Spring Boot application development concepts like auto-configuration and embedded web container deployments (Spring Boot)</p></li>
<li><p><em>REST APIs</em> - we'll look at concerns like API versioning and hypermedia. (Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring HATEOAS)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Access</em> - we'll model a service domain and define bounded contexts. (Spring Boot, Spring Data)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Observability</em> - what happens when there's a problem with your production application? How quickly can your team respond? How do you know if you're making improvements to a system? How do you measure progress? How do you monitor individual applications? How do you monitor the flow of requests through circuit breakers? How do you trace requests across the system? Can you visualize all the services in the system? We'll look at how to surface information about your services and systems. (Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, Graphite, Spring Cloud Sleuth, OpenZipkin, Spring Cloud Hystrix Dashboard)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Testing</em> - we'll look at the concepts of test-driven development. We'll cover unit testing individual components and mock them out. We'll look at how to test service interfaces. We'll look at how to write integration tests that don't sacrifice speed in order to be exhaustive using consumer driven contracts and consumer driven contract testing. (JUnit, Spring Boot, Spring MVC Test Framework, Spring Cloud Contract)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Routing and Load-Balancing</em> - where does your service live? How do your clients find it? How do you handle custom routing requirements? How do you handle custom load-balancing? (Spring Cloud, Ribbon)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Message-driven and integration-centric architectures</em> - We'll look at how to build microservices that talk to each other over messaging fabrics like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. We'll look at how to integrate existing systems and how to use messaging to connect disparate systems. (RabbitMQ, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stream Processing</em> - We'll look at how to build solutions that process ongoing data over time. We'll look at how to compose messaging-based microservices and orchestrate them over a cloud-based fabric. (Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Data Flow)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Partitioned Batch Processing</em> - In this section we'll look at how to process large amounts of sequential data and scale the processing across a cloud fabric. We'll look at how to scale processing horizontally as our processing needs demand. (Spring Batch, Spring Integration)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reliability Patterns</em> - In this section we'll look at how to employ retries and circuit breakers to build fault-tolerence into service invocations. We'll look at approaches to gracefully degrade if a service invocation should fail. (Spring Cloud Hystrix, Spring Retry, Spring Boot)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ad-hoc Task Processing</em> - Need to send an email? Resize an image? Generate a report? In this section we'll look at a few ways to distribute these longer-running workloads across a cloud fabric. (Spring Batch, Spring Cloud Task, Spring Cloud Data Flow)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Workflow</em> - In this section we'll look at how to use a workflow engine to choreograph work across a cloud platform, using messaging-centric microservics and incorporating human actors to achieve a result. (Activiti, Spring Cloud Stream)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Edge-services</em> - In this section we'll look at how to build client-centric adapter APIs. and concerns like rate limiting, backends-for-front-ends, proxying, and other cross-cutting concerns. (Spring Cloud, Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Security</em> - In this section we'll look at how to secure individual microservices. We'll look at how to perpetuate authenticated principals across service invocations with OAuth. (Spring Boot, Spring Security OAuth, Spring Cloud Security)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Service Registration and Discovery</em> - In this section we'll look at how to register and discover services dynamically with a service registry like Netflix Eureka or Hashicorp Consul. (Spring Cloud)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Functions-as-a-service</em> - In this section we'll look at how to build serverless-style applications (Spring Cloud Function)</p></li></ul>


### Bootiful Testing (1-3h)

<p>How would you feel if you knew that any pat of the code was at most a few minutes away from being shippable and delivered into production? How would you feel if you knew that any part of the code is a few ctrl+z's away from being shippable and delivered into production? Emboldened and confident? Test driven development (TDD) gives you that. TDD allows you to proceed with confidence that you're building the right thing. It provides you with imminent-horizons that you can meet and measure. TDD gives developers the confidence to go faster, secure in the knowledge that what they break they will fix and be able to improve. In this talk, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) as he looks at how to test Spring applications and services. We'll look at how to test basic components, mocks, how to take advantage of test slices, and how to test web applications. We'll also look at how to ensure that API producers and API consumers work well together using consumer driven contract testing (CDCT) without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end integration tests.</p>


### Bootiful GraphQL

<p>Hi Spring fans! Data wants to be free and so much of what we do in the wide and wonderful world of microservices is all about connecting data. It's difficult. There's a tension between how we build well-encapsulated microservices and how we connect their data in our clients. Until now. Facebook open sourced GraphQL in 2015 (also the same year that "Avengers: Age of Ultron," a movie about a psychotic super computer that wanted to take over the world came out. No coincidence, surely...). GraphQL is an alternative to the REST constraint on HTTP. It provides an easy way to model queries (reads, like an HTTP <code>GET</code>), subscriptions (longer-lived, asynchronous notifications sent to the client) and mutations (updates). Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman), and we'll look at how to build data gateways for every clients' needs with Spring GraphQL.</p>


### Cloud Native Java (3-6h)

<p>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming</p>
<p>Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>


### Bootiful Kotlin

<p>Spring Boot, the convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development on the JVM not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production. The framework is as clean as it gets, wouldn't it be nice if the language matched its elegance?</p>
<p>Kotlin, the productivity-focused language from our friends at JetBrains, takes up the slack to make the experience leaner, cleaner and even more pleasant!</p>
<p>The Spring and Kotlin teams have worked hard to make sure that Kotlin and Spring Boot are a first-class experience for all developers trying to get to production, faster and safer. Come for the Spring and stay for the Bootiful Kotlin.</p>


### Kubernetes Native Java

<p>Spring is all about helping developers get to production quickly and safely. These days, "production" is all but guaranteed to mean Kubernetes, and Spring has you covered. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long (@starbuxman)</a>, and we'll look at how Spring Boot makes writing blisteringly fast, cloud-native, and scalable services more effortless than ever.</p>


### New Year, New Spring

<p>Hi, Spring fans! It's 2022, a brand new year, and this year's going to be a big one! There's a lot in store - Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, Spring GraphQL, GraalVM native image support, and so much more. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman), and we'll look at a new Spring for a new year and new paradigms.</p>


### Cloud Native Java (2 days)

<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java systems that are elastic, agile, observable and robust.</p>
