[Josh (@starbuxman)](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) became the first Spring Developer Advocate in 2010 and hasn't looked back! He contributes (bugs, mostly..) to _numerous_ open source projects, including Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

<!--more-->

## What Can He Do For You?

Josh has a variety of talks and workshops on the following topics:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Architecture
- Microservices
- Full Stack Java Development
- GraphQL
- Enterprise Application Integration
- Workflow
- Spring Data
- ..and countless other ecosystem libraries

He is a world-renowned speaker who has spoken on every continent except Antarctica at thousands of events, shows, and organizations.

## _Spring Tips_

Josh puts together a weekly series on YouTube, [_Spring Tips_](https://bit.ly/spring-tips-playlist), where he explores the latest-and-greatest in the wide and wonderful world of Springdom

## Books

Josh has authored a [half dozen books on Spring](https://joshlong.com/#books), and some of them, like [_Reactive Spring_](https://reactivespring.io) are not terrible!

## This Week in Spring

Josh has put out an installment of _This Week in Spring_ over [on the Spring blog](https://spring.io/blog) every Tuesday - without fail, since the first week of January 2010! -  that (attempts, and often fails to) round up the latest and greatest in the wonderful and wide world of Springdom.

## _A Bootiful Podcast_

Josh is the host of a podcast called [_A Bootiful Podcast_](https://bootifulpodcast.fm) whose new episodes drop every Friday (roughly). In it, he sits down and talks to people that are smarter than he is (a shallow bar!) about  the Spring and adjacent ecosystems.

## Livelessons

Josh has done longer-form training courses - seen by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide - [on the Livelessons platform](https://joshlong.com/livelessons.html) since 2013.

## Abstracts

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026-->
### Bootiful Kafka: Get the Message!

<p>Hi, Spring fans! I once met Dave Chapelle (no, not <em>that</em> Dave Chapelle!), who was a legend from the messaging industry. He worked on SonicMQ and a bunch of other famous messaging initiatives. He also wrote <em>the</em> O'Reilly book on the Java Messaging Service. I met him once, asked him to sign my copy of the book. He wrote, "Get the message!" and then signed it. I always loved him for that. And that's what I want you to do. Spring Boot and Apache Kafka are leaders in their respective fields and it's no surprise that they work well together. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long (@starbuxman)</a> and we'll look at how to use Spring Boot and Apache Kafka to build better, scalable systems and services so that you, too, can <em>get the message</em>!</p>

### Cloud Native Java (5-10 Days)

<p>?It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.? -W. Edwards Deming</p>
<p>Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It?s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget ?devops,? cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.</p>
<p>But velocity, for velocity?s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we?ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java applications. A cloud native application is:</p>
<ul><li>elastic</li>
<li>agile</li>
<li>observable</li>
<li>robust</li></ul>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is designed to fully exploit a cloud platform both in the application layer - where things decompose into microservices - and at the data layer where NoSQL offers better horizontal scaling and fitness for specific purpose. This is what we mean by <em>elastic</em>.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>agile</em>. It should be easy to write, change, test, deploy and operate. If the cost of change is prohibitive then normal people under normal situations won't do it. We must make doing the right thing - that which supports change - the easy thing.</p>
<p>A cloud native system is <em>observable</em>. It must support at-a-glance insight into what is happening in the system and support remediation. It must be instrumented at the application and systems levels to support the effort of crisis-management.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>fault tolerant</em>, or <em>robust</em>. If a service should fail, the system must be able to recover and degrade gracefully. Instead of trying to build a system that is predicated on the lie that things are highly available, build instead to optimize for time to remediation.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll cover:</p>
<ul><li><p><em>Basics</em> - we'll look at Spring Boot application development concepts like auto-configuration and embedded web container deployments (Spring Boot)</p></li>
<li><p><em>REST APIs</em> - we'll look at concerns like API versioning and hypermedia. (Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring HATEOAS)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Data Access</em> - we'll model a service domain and define bounded contexts. (Spring Boot, Spring Data)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Observability</em> - what happens when there's a problem with your production application? How quickly can your team respond? How do you know if you're making improvements to a system? How do you measure progress? How do you monitor individual applications? How do you monitor the flow of requests through circuit breakers? How do you trace requests across the system? Can you visualize all the services in the system? We'll look at how to surface information about your services and systems. (Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, Graphite, Spring Cloud Sleuth, OpenZipkin, Spring Cloud Hystrix Dashboard)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Testing</em> - we'll look at the concepts of test-driven development. We'll cover unit testing individual components and mock them out. We'll look at how to test service interfaces. We'll look at how to write integration tests that don't sacrifice speed in order to be exhaustive using consumer driven contracts and consumer driven contract testing. (JUnit, Spring Boot, Spring MVC Test Framework, Spring Cloud Contract)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Routing and Load-Balancing</em> - where does your service live? How do your clients find it? How do you handle custom routing requirements? How do you handle custom load-balancing? (Spring Cloud, Ribbon)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Message-driven and integration-centric architectures</em> - We'll look at how to build microservices that talk to each other over messaging fabrics like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. We'll look at how to integrate existing systems and how to use messaging to connect disparate systems. (RabbitMQ, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Stream Processing</em> - We'll look at how to build solutions that process ongoing data over time. We'll look at how to compose messaging-based microservices and orchestrate them over a cloud-based fabric. (Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Data Flow)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Partitioned Batch Processing</em> - In this section we'll look at how to process large amounts of sequential data and scale the processing across a cloud fabric. We'll look at how to scale processing horizontally as o
