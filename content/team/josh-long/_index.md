[I (@starbuxman)](https://twitter.com/starbuxman) became the first Spring Developer Advocate in 2010 and haven't looked back! I contribute (of bugs, mostly..) to _numerous_ open source projects, including Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.

## _Spring Tips_ 

I put together a weekly series on YouTube, [_Spring Tips_](https://bit.ly/spring-tips-playlist), where I explore the latest-and-greatest in the wide and wonderful world of Springdom 

## Books

I've authored a [half dozen books on Spring](https://joshlong.com/#books), and some of them, like [_Reactive Spring_](https://reactivespring.io) are not terrible! 

## This Week in Spring 

I've put out an installment of _This Week in Spring_ over [on the Spring blog](https://spring.io/blog) every Tuesday - without fail, since the first week of January 2010! -  that (attempts, and often fails to) round up the latest and greatest in the wonderful and wide world of Springdom. 

## _A Bootiful Podcast_

I put out a podcast called [_A Bootiful Podcast_](https://bootifulpodcast.fm) every Friday (roughly), wherein I sit down and talk to people that are smarter than I am (a shallow bar!) about the Spring and adjacent ecosystems. 

## Livelessons 

I've done longer-form training courses - seen by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide - [on the Livelessons platform](https://joshlong.com/livelessons.html).
