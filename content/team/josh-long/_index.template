## _Spring Tips_ 

Josh puts together a weekly series on YouTube, [_Spring Tips_](https://bit.ly/spring-tips-playlist), where he explores the latest-and-greatest in the wide and wonderful world of Springdom 

## Books

Josh has authored a [half dozen books on Spring](https://joshlong.com/#books), and some of them, like [_Reactive Spring_](https://reactivespring.io) are not terrible! 

## This Week in Spring 

Josh has put out an installment of _This Week in Spring_ over [on the Spring blog](https://spring.io/blog) every Tuesday - without fail, since the first week of January 2010! -  that (attempts, and often fails to) round up the latest and greatest in the wonderful and wide world of Springdom. 

## _A Bootiful Podcast_

Josh is the host of a podcast called [_A Bootiful Podcast_](https://bootifulpodcast.fm) whose new episodes drop every Friday (roughly). In it, he sits down and talks to people that are smarter than he is (a shallow bar!) about  the Spring and adjacent ecosystems. 

## Livelessons 

Josh has done longer-form training courses - seen by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide - [on the Livelessons platform](https://joshlong.com/livelessons.html) since 2013.
