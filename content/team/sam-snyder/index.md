Sam Snyder has spent the past decade working on improving developer happiness with better tooling. At Tableau software, he used data from the development and deployment pipeline to systematically seize the greatest opportunities for improvement and eliminate the greatest pain points. At Gradle, he integrated that process and data visualization methodology into Gradle Enterprise. Now, as VP of Engineering at Moderne, Sam leads the team responsible for the core refactoring technologies with which to automate away the tedious, repetitive parts of software development.
