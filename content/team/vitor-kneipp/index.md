In his spare time, he helps humanitarian refugees to build their businesses in the UK and trains university students to build products that meet the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. He earned an MBA from the University of Oxford's Sa√Ød Business School and a LL.B. from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, and is an outspoken advocate of business practices and public policy that address systemic humanitarian challenges of our time.
