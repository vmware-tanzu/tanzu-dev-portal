Vitor has been a member of the VMware Tanzu Labs team since 2019 and delights in bringing his views of systems to a wide variety of clients.

Prior to joining VMware Tanzu, Vitor had co-founded an award-winning fintech startup, providing underprivileged communities in Brazil with access to banking. He also designed and developed training in the maritime shipping industry which became the official standard adopted by the Brazilian Maritime Authorities. In his spare time, he helps humanitarian refugees to build their businesses in the UK and trains university students to build products that meet the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. He earned an MBA from the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School and a LL.B. from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, and is an outspoken advocate of business practices and public policy that address systemic humanitarian challenges of our time.
