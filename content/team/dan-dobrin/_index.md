Dan Dobrin is an architect in the VMware Tanzu team, helping developers, architects and enterprises adopt modern patterns, practices and technologies including Tanzu, Kubernetes, Spring, Event-driven Architecture, and CI/CD. Prior to joining Pivotal/VMware, he has built high-performance, flexible frameworks for security and financial services organizations. An avid learner, he's always looking for the next practical idea to experiment and share with a client. 

When he leaves the gadgets behind, you'll find him hiking with his children, running a marathon, biking on a trail or reading a good book.
