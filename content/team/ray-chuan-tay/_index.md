Ray is an engineer with VMware Tanzu Labs, and has worked with teams from startups and enterprises practice modern application development. He has probably spent too much time at the terminal overthinking commands, keystrokes, key layout, and keyboard makes. He also enjoys spending time with his children and the occasional commute on bike.
