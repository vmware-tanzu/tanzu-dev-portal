She programs mostly using Java and Groovy. Before switching to working full-time on open-source libraries and frameworks, she has gained experience working with microservices where cutting-edge solutions were used as well as with complex legacy systems, implementing both new business features and tools aimed at improving the process of continuous deployment and setup of applications. Olga is also a contributor to various other OSS projects, including RestAssured, JFairy, Jenkins Pipeline Plugin, Jenkins Stash Pull Request Builder Plugin, and others.

Before switching to development, she worked for more than 3 years as a Quality Assurance Engineer, specialized in test automation.
