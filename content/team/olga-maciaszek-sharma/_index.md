Olga is also a contributor to various other OSS projects, including RestAssured, JFairy, Jenkins Pipeline Plugin, Jenkins Stash Pull Request Builder Plugin, and others.

Before switching to development, she worked for more than 3 years as a Quality Assurance Engineer, specialized in test automation.
