Mario is a principal technologist at VMware with more than 20 years of experience in software development and software architecture. He is co-author of _Pro Spring Integration_ (Apress, 2011). He’s helped organizations large and small build service-based architectures in a number of different runtimes and platforms over the decades, but adopting Spring in 2004, and using it whenever possible since, was a no-brainer that culminated in joining the Spring team in 2017. As a Spring developer advocate, Mario loves to engage and inspire developers and businesses in the Pivotal ecosystem.

## What's This Advocate Talk About?

Mario talks about computing's effects on our team workflow, why we comment---or don't---and the following tertiary topics:

- Reactive Programming
- Enterprise Integration Patterns (book too!)
- Across the Stack Architecture Concepts
- Democratized Deployment Processes
- Agile-ific Testing (unit, functional, integration)
- Spring/Boot/Cloud

### Talks and Demos

#### Redis Day Tel Aviv 2019

Implementing a reactive application with Redis 5.0 is made easier using the [Spring Data Redis](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-redis) support or its [reactive cousin](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-data-reactive-redis/). This tutorial explains several common Redis operations and includes detailed examples of interacting with Redis-bound data and REST applications.

#### Bootiful Testing with TDD

Join us for an exploration of testing a reactive Spring Boot 2.x application. Test-driven development gives us the confidence necessary to improve our code faster, safely. But how do you test components and services, as well as integrations across distributed systems, while maintaining fast feedback loops, and how do you do all of this within the context of reactive Java? In this talk, we'll look at how to test imperative components, reactive data flows, and mocks. We’ll examine how to take advantage of test slices and how to test web applications. We'll look at how to ensure that API producers and consumers work well together using consumer-driven contract testing without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end integration tests.
