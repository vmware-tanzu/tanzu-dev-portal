Josh loves to code, and his kids love to code, too! Since the early days with a TRS-80 from Radio Shack, he’s loved building whatever came to mind. These days, he contributes full-time to the Spring Security codebase. He also is the author of a handful of Pluralsight courses about web application security in Java, which all feature Terracotta Bank, an open source intentionally-vulnerable web application that helps engineers practice ethical hacking as well as secure coding in Java. When Josh isn’t coding, he’s dunking over his kids on a seven-foot basketball hoop, eating Frosted Mini-Wheats, or reading Brandon Sanderson. Or he’s coding.
