Toby Rumans is a software engineer at VMware focusing on enabling Tanzu clients in agile and modern software practices. Toby has proven to be an expert in front end and testing methodologies through his career at VMware, and continually shows up with skill and empathy when consulting. He loves to teach, and actively looks for opportunities to mentor or sponsor folks in his organization. Toby loves SQL, though he has extensive experience in Java Spring, Kotlin, and React as well. Toby has always been deeply interested in front end technologies, and believes proficient front end practices are equally as important as they are in the back end.
