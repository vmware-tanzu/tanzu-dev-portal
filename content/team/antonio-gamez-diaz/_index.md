Antonio Gámez Díaz is currently pursuing a PhD in Software Engineering from the University of Seville (2021), after a shift from the academia to the technology industry in 2020. Antonio joined VMware and now helps the community to deploy applications in the cloud with Kubeapps, a completely open-source project. His research interests in Software Engineering are focused on Service-Oriented Computing, specifically on RESTful systems governance using SLAs. In the past, he has participated in several research projects and has collaborated with leading organizations such as the OpenAPI Initiative or GitHub Education for the technological and industrial knowledge diffusion. Currently, he actively participates in the VMware Multicloud Academy, an initiative to bring the technological background at VMware closer to our university undergrads.
