Jorge is a Developer Experience Engineer at VMware working with Kubernetes platforms. He has huge experience in DevOps and he's a fanatical Java developer but never afraid of learning new languages. Heâ€™s been helping developers understand the benefits of Kubernetes based platforms and he has invested huge amount of time trying to improve the developer experience on it. Big fan of open-source projects, where he spends some time doing some contributions.
He's old enough to have other hobbies than his family for his occasional spare time.
