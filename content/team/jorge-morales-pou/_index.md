Jorge is a Developer Experience Engineer at VMware working with Kubernetes platforms. He has huge experience in DevOps and he's a fanatical Java developer but never afraid of learning new languages. He’s been helping developers understand the benefits of Kubernetes based platforms and he has invested huge amount of time trying to improve the developer experience on it. Big fan of open-source projects, where he spends some time doing some contributions.
He's old enough to have other hobbies than his family for his occasional spare time.
