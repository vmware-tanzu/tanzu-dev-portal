My name is Bryan Kelly I am a Software Engineer at Cerner.  At Cerner, I focus on delivery automation specifically using the Tanzu catalog of products.  Since 2007 I have been an avid Spring Framework / Java user.  In recent years I have focused on the adoption and day-to-day operations of Tanzu Application Service.  In the past few months, I have been transitioning to leveraging Tanzu Application Platform on Kubernetes for application delivery.
