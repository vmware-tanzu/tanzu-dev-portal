Gerhard is a staff engineer at VMware where he works on RabbitMQ operations, resiliency & observability. Shipping straight into production and testing in production are some of Gerhard's favourites, only second to efficient infrastructure, monitored well. Driving for pleasure and taking as long as it takes to prepare the perfect cortado (scales and stopwatches are involved) are common pastimes.
