Adrià started his software developer journey in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) as an iOS and Android developer for a security startup specialized in Public Key Infrastructure. He eventually moved to the United States where he joined Pivotal Labs in 2016. 

Since then, he has become an expert in Agile and XP practices and has helped many clients adopt modern development techniques while delivering amazing test-driven products and solutions. 

Even though he started out as a mobile developer, he now has expertise in all levels of the stack. Adrià is proficient in creating great applications using Spring Boot, Node, React, Angular, React Native, Flutter, iOS, and Android! 

His experience goes beyond coding; he has delivered many talks and presentations on topics ranging from non-technical, such as team health checks and extreme programming, to granular and technical, such as contract testing and evolutionary architecture.

Outside of work, Adrià enjoys cooking, travelling the world, and practicing and teaching Kendo (japanese fencing).
