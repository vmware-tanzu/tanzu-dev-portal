Adrià began his software journey in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) as an iOS and Android developer for a security startup that specialized in Public Key Infrastructure. Later on, he moved to the United States and joined Pivotal Labs in 2016, where he has become an expert in Agile and XP practices. He has helped many clients adopt modern development techniques while delivering amazing test-driven products and solutions.

Even though he started out as a mobile developer, Adrià now has expertise in all levels of the stack. He is proficient in creating great applications using Spring Boot, Node, React, Angular, React Native, Flutter, iOS, and Android! His experience goes beyond coding as he has delivered many talks and presentations on topics ranging from non-technical, such as team health checks and extreme programming, to granular and technical, such as contract testing and evolutionary architecture.

Apart from work, Adrià enjoys cooking, travelling the world, and practicing and teaching Kendo (Japanese fencing).
