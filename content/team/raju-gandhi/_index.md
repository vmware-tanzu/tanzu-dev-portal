Raju Gandhi is the founder of DefMacro Software, LLC. He lives in Columbus, Ohio, along with his wonderful wife, Michelle; their sons, Mason and Micah; and their three furry family members—their two dogs, Buddy and Skye, and Princess Zara, their cat. Raju is a consultant, author, teacher, and regularly invited speaker at conferences around the world. In his career as both a software developer and a teacher, he believes in keeping things simple. His approach is always to understand and explain the “why,” as opposed to the “how.” Raju blogs at https://www.looselytyped.com, and can be found on Twitter as @looselytyped. He’s always looking to make new friends. You can find his contact information at https://www.rajugandhi.com.
