Lauren is currently a Staff Product Designer for Tanzu Learning at VMware and has also been a consultant for Tanzu Labs (Pivotal) in the past. Although she's designed for a wide variety of clients and industries, generally speaking, Lauren simply enjoys finding ways to use technology and design to solve unique problems and make a positive impact. When she's not behind a computer you can find Lauren hiking, snapping photos, or on the prowl for a good croissant.
