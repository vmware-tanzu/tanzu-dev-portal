Phillip is a senior product manager at Honeycomb, focusing on all things developer experience: OpenTelemetry, Honeycomb's GitHub presence, Honeycomb's API and SDKs, and more! Prior to Honeycomb, Phillip worked at Microsoft and helped build the modern cross-platform .NET, multiple version of the F# language and F# tooling, and a smattering of other developer tooling experiences. He's a big fan of functional programming and snowboarding, so you can ask him about that stuff too!
