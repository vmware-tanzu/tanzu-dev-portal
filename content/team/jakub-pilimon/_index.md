[Jakub](https://twitter.com/JakubPilimon) is a Developer Advocate at [VMware](https://vmware.com), blogger, programmer, and trainer. He loves to tackle complex enterprises with Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development and Spring. Architecture is a main area of interest, too. When he doesn't program, he rides motorbikes, skis or practices kitesurfing.

He writes a [DZone MVB awarded blog](https://pillopl.github.io) and his pet projects can be found at [https://github.com/ddd-by-examples](https://github.com/ddd-by-examples).

## What can he do for you ?

Jakub can speak or host workshops on the following topics, both from VMware Product, and Opensource/Community perspectives:

* Architecture (System and Application)
* Domain-Driven Design
* Spring/Spring Boot/Spring Cloud
* Refactoring/Modernization
* Unit Testing
* Reactive Programming

Jakub can host a modelling session or architecture review using:

* Event Storming
* Modelling in OOP
* Modelling in FP
* Big Ball Of Mud vs. Modular Monoliths vs. Microservices

## Highlights

#### State or Events - Which Shall I Keep?

Tired of fancy abstractions without actual down to earth implementation? In this talk we will go through both benefits and problems by implementing a real example of event-sourced model. This is a full-time live coding and we will develop features in parallel - one of us in a classic ORM-based way and the other one using event sourcing. We are going to tackle the problems step by step in both solutions from various perspectives. From the point of view of the stakeholders our software should have quick time to market, ability to do complex data reporting and fast way to extend and to deploy new features. On the other hand, our fellow developers would be interested in learning curve when it comes to event sourcing and how it differs in turns of e.g. unit testing. At the end of each step it will be clear what kind of problems/benefits we have using one of two models. The talk is going to cover a broad set of buzzwords like: event sourcing, CQRS, distributed systems, spring cloud stream, eventual consistency, unit testing and zero downtime deployments.

#### Refactoring and Getting Rid of Big Ball Of Mud

We’ve all been there, facing a blinking cursor. You need to build a new feature, but aren’t sure where to start. Or you have to fix something in your app, and you’re unsure why it broke.
This situation is common with Big Ball of Mud architectures. This design hinders your release velocity. And it makes it near-impossible to seize new business opportunities. How can you move on from this situation?
Most of us also know what good design is. We talk a lot about Domain-Driven Design, modeling, event storming and Test-Driven Development.
Here’s the challenge: how to apply this thinking to your current systems. How do we modernize the app? How do convince people we should modernize it? How do we overcome the lack of testing? Or lack of business knowledge?
Attend this session to answer these questions and more. You’ll learn about techniques that have proven to work in companies like yours.

#### Unit Testing Done Right

“TDD leads to a great design,” they said. “Mocking is bad,” they said. “Integration testing is slow,” they said. “Testable architecture to the rescue,” they said. “If you don’t test, don’t call yourself a developer,” they said. “Code coverage must be 100%,” they said. And so on and so forth.

In this talk, we’ll tackle some of the testing gotchas. There will be live coding, architecture rants, some slides and (hopefully) much fun. Both senior and junior developers should find something interesting in that testing example.
