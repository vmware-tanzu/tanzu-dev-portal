## Welcome back üëã

I can't believe we're through September already! My favourite time of year is fast approaching - Autumn - or Fall for our friends across the pond! Well, in the Northern Hemisphere at least!

Joining us this month is the amazing Rachel Appel. Rachel is a good friend of mine and we share a love for tea done well!

Rachel holds a master‚Äôs degree in Advanced Software Engineering and currently works for JetBrains as a Developer Advocate. She has been in the business of creating software for over 30 years, as an author, mentor, and speaker. During her career, she has worked on projects of all sizes from the smallest of apps to the largest enterprise systems at some of the world‚Äôs leading companies. Rachel‚Äôs expertise is in web development on the Microsoft stack, specifically ASP.NET, Azure Functions, SignalR, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

## Rachel's thoughts

Dark Patterns have become a more popular topic of conversation in software, and rightfully so. You may not have heard the term, but you likely have experienced a dark pattern. Dark patterns are characteristics or behaviours in software that manipulate or deceive users. Perhaps you've tried to purchase something and you notice a warranty that's been added to the cart - but not by you. Or you try to cancel that subscription and can't, because there is no way to do so online, so you have to call and wait for a long time. They're trying to get you to give up rather than cancel, and many people do. Airlines have been known to offer that 39‚Ç¨ seat that ends up being over ten times the quoted price because of sneaky fees and dark pattern upsells in their software. The travel industry got so bad that the UK and the USA as well as several other countries created laws regarding dark patterns. Dark patterns have cost consumers millions of dollars in cash plus millions in lost time. In some cases, these dark patterns are breaking local laws. Software that uses them is objectively lower in quality than software that avoids them. Dark patterns make software sketchy.

At this point, you might ask yourself, "As a developer, what can I do so that my team isn't putting dark patterns into our software?" Firstly, talk to management and make sure they‚Äôre on board with the fact that eliminating dark patterns is also a quality metric. This means you‚Äôll need to learn more about dark patterns and how they work (links below). Once you have a general understanding of dark patterns, ask management to ensure dark pattern removal is part of the quality metrics. Then the design and testing teams can work to actively thwart them and make a much better experience for your customers. If you‚Äôre not already ‚Äúdogfooding‚Äù your software, now is a great time to start. Watch users but also thoughtfully use your own software. Consider every action and click you make. Did you feel forced into an action? Is something confusing or is information lacking? These are common dark techniques (airline favourites) that are easily avoidable with a bit of good design and quality assurance.

[Optimizing .NET code: Hunting for allocations](https://endjin.com/blog/2023/09/optimising-dotnet-code-2-hunting-for-allocations) - Jonathan George talks us through a basic approach to determining where memory allocations come from.

[Tools and Libraries for Building Cloud-Ready Apps in .NET](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2023/09/19/cloud-ready-net.aspx) - this month, I was interviewed by Visual Studio Magazine, where we talk about building cloud-ready apps.
