## Welcome ðŸŽ‰!

This is the first edition of this newsletter, titled "Hooked on .NET", where every month we'll have a guest from the community share their current thoughts and views, and anything they've recently found interesting in the .NET ecosystem and supporting technologies. We'll cast our net wide to gain the thoughts and ideas of those in the community, including the excellent engineers working behind the scenes at VMware.

My name's [Layla](https://layla.dev), but most peeps know me as *LaylaCodesIt* on the interweb, and I'll be your editor on this endeavour. I'm a developer advocate at VMware Tanzu focused on the .NET community.

For my crimes, I'm a 5 times Microsoft MVP, GitHub Star, Progress Ninja, and the founder of the #WomenOfDotNet Initiative.

This newsletter will tend to enterprise software development, but we'll cover all aspects of software development as we can learn something from everything.
