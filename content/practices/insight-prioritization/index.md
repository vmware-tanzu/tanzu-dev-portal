title: Insight Prioritization
what:
- Whiteboard or digital version like [Miro](https://miro.com/)
- Painter's tape
- Any insights you've identified in previous workshops
when:
- During Discovery & Framing, after conducting and synthesizing exploratory research.
why:
- Insight Prioritization helps us understand "what are the first set of problems that
  need solving?". It looks at insights—"aha!" moments where critical thinking results
  in a meaningful conclusion—in order to help provide color to our problem space and
  eventual solutions.

## How to Use this Method
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Gather all the insights you discovered from research     

1. If there are many (roughly 20+), first do a culling exercise by asking yourselves _"Will this insight help me make an informed product decision for this project or consulting engagement period?"_ Sort each Insight into a "No" or "Yes" pile on the wall

   {{% callout %}}
   Tip: You can clarify this prompt further by adding additional context: “Could you use this insight to create or modify solutions? Can it be re-framed into a useful “how might we …” statement?”

1. Once you have a simplified list, create a 2x2 with the painter's tape and label the axes as follows:

   - X-Axis → Smaller Size of Opportunity (left) to Greater Size of Opportunity (right)
   - Y-Axis → Less Useful for Making Product Decisions (bottom) to More Useful for Making Product Decisions (top)

1. Plot the "Yes" insights on the 2x2, striving to end with a list of the top 3-5 insights

   {{% callout %}}
   Tip: If the top right quadrant is packed with insights, draw a second 2x2 within that quadrant and discuss what has fallen out—with some additional conversation, the team will generally agree that the new top right quadrant truly does have the highest priority insights

#### Success/Expected Outcomes
Success is achieved when the team agrees to the top 3-5 Insights on which it will focus
