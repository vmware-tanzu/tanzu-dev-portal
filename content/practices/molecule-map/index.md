why:
- Molecule maps help team members understand that there are multiple possible solutions to a user’s need, and that solutions are best understood alongside their relationship to these users and needs

when:
- Early in the project, normally during Kickoff and Inception.

what:
- Sharpies
- 8.5" x 11” or A4 paper
- Whiteboard

## How to Use this Method
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Draw an example molecule on the whiteboard

   - Persona — Who are we helping? (use the [Personas](/practices/personas) practice) practice if you haven't created one yet)
   - Problem — What is one of their problems?
   - Solution — What is our solution?

1. Get into groups of 3 or ask each person to draw 3 circles on a piece of paper and draw multiple molecules. Come up with as many solutions as possible.

1. Tape molecules onto the board. Treat these as assumptions to go validate.

1. Silent read & dot vote to get down to 1 molecule

#### Success/Expected Outcomes
Success is when you have agreement on the problem and solution (aka snapshot)to move forward with as a team. You’re doing it right when you are thinking of users as humans.
