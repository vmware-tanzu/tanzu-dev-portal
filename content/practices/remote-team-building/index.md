  topic, or simply just to wake up a sleepy and tired group.

## Icebreakers
An icebreaker is a fun, interactive game that acts as an informal introduction and creates a personal connection among the team. The use of an icebreaker game can diminish some of the inherent challenges of remote teamwork. Take a look at how and when to best employ icebreakers for distributed teams.

## Question Icebreaker

## Creative Warm Ups
To encourage creativity! But rather than using it to judge an individual’s creative abilities, it can be used to identify our natural creative weaknesses and highlight how working as a group increases the number of solutions.

### Circles
Spark creativity while drawing many different patterns using Miro.

## Recaps & Warm Downs
This wind-down activity gives participants a safe space to share how they feel visually instead of verbally in relation to others within the team, and to close out a session in preparation for a retro, the next session or end of day.

### Smiley Faces
Finish a session by gauging the final emotional pulse.
