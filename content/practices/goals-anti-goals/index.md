what:
- Whiteboard or digital version like [Miro](https://miro.com/)
- Dry erase markers
- Sticky notes
- Sharpies
- Painter's tape (optional)
when:
- We do this as early as possible during a project, usually defining them during Kickoff
  and revisiting them at Inception.
why:
- Goals help the team decide where to focus their time and efforts. By developing
  them hand-in-hand with stakeholders, we can align ourselves around shared goals
  and avoid any unnecessary or unwanted surprises down the road.

## How to Use this Method

{{% section %}}
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Draw 4 columns on the whiteboard, one for each type of goal. Put anti-goal column off to the side to introduce it later.

1. Write out goal types on board along with prompts:

   - **Product goals** - “What impact do we want to have on our product space?”
   - **Business goals** - “What does success look like from a business perspective? Are there any important dates that we need to consider?”
   - **Project / Consulting engagement goals** - “As a team, what do we want to accomplish during our time together?”
   - **Anti-goals** - “What do we want to accomplish someday that would distract the team today?”

1. Give 7 minutes of brainstorming time. Ask everyone to write as many ideas as possible, 1 per sticky note.

1. In 2 minutes, have each person pick their top 2 goals for each category and rip up everything else. Remember to mention that this is okay!

1. Go around the room and have everyone share out the 8 goals they selected. Have a co-facilitator put the sticky notes on the board in the right columns.

1. As each person shares out, ask other people if they have a duplicate. Group these similar goals together.

1. When everyone has shared, hand out 6 dots per person and have everyone dot vote on their top 2 product, business, and project/consulting engagement goals (there’s no need to vote on the anti-goals). Circle the top 2 goals that emerge.

1. Confirm with key stakeholder(s) if there’s anything else really important that we’ve missed. If so, circle those as well or write them down.

### Success/Expected Outcomes
Success is when the core team and stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the top product, business, project/consulting engagement, and anti-goals.

### Facilitator Notes & Tips

If you have a lot of people in your Kickoff (e.g. 15+), consider asking everyone to organize themselves into groups of 3-4 people. This will simplify the process of sharing out and affinity mapping the generated goals.
