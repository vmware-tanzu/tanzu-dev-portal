- The provisional persona anchors the discussions we have during the Kickoff and allows the core team to make smart decisions about who to target for exploratory research during the Discovery phase of the project.

when:
- We try to do this as early as possible on a project, usually during Kickoff.

what:
- Whiteboard
- Paper
- Sharpies / markers
- Sticky dots
- Scissors (optional)

## How to Use this Method
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Divide room into small groups and give a piece of paper to each group
        
   {{% callout %}}
   Tip: If the group is small, you can also do this exercise individually
   {{% /callout %}}
1. Define “persona” for the room and remind all participants this is a provisional persona—through research, what we think we know about this person will change and evolve

   {{% callout %}}
   Example: "A persona is a composite user used to create empathy on the team and allows you to understand the users well and design a product for them.”
   {{% /callout %}}

1. Have each group (or person) fold paper into quadrants

1. Draw a template on the board with the following in each quadrant:
   - Top left → drawing of person in a place, doing an action, with a name, face, emotion, and thought
   - Bottom left → demographics (facts like name, age, role, income, location, gender)
   - Top right → behaviors (things they do, likes, dislikes, hobbies)
   - Bottom right → needs and goals (wants, pains, hopes)

1. Have the teams (or individuals) work silently for 7-8 minutes to fill out paper according to the template

1. Ask each team to send a representative (or have each individual come) to the board to hang the persona and describe the person they created for the group

1. Give each person four dots so that they can place a dot on the quadrant that they think best explains the user (so four dots in total, one on each quadrant across all papers)

1. Tape together the highest scoring quadrants into one "master persona" and reads it to the group

   {{% callout %}}
   Tip: It's helpful to have scissors handy in case you need to cut quadrants apart in order to reassemble
   {{% /callout %}}
#### Success/Expected Outcomes
Success is when you've created a "master persona" and everyone in the room feels like it represents the target audience as best as possible.
