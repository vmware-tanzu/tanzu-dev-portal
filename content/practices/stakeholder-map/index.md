- Identifies who is involved in a project
- Identifies who is invested in the outcome
- Identifies who has right of refusal

  by what is built.

## How to Use this Method

{{% section %}}
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Provide all attendees at Kickoff with a large sticky note and have them write their:

   - Name
   - Title
   - Department

1. Organize the sticky notes on the whiteboard before starting activity, placing the core team in the center, surrounded by clustered departments and project sponsors

   {{% callout %}}   
   **Note**: A core team member is someone who will be working on the project full-time
   {{% /callout %}}   

   {{% callout %}}   
   **Tip**: Creating a "straw man" version of the stakeholder map makes it easier for participants to edit what they see vs. create a map from scratch
   {{% /callout %}}   

   Make sure people have name tags beforehand, it helps when calling on people
  
1. Walk through each "straw man" group and ask participants how they could support the core team

1. Create circles for departments and teams and connect people and/or teams with lines and directional arrows

1. Star key points of contact, especially if a department circle contains multiple people

### Facilitator Notes & Tips

This exercise has a tendency to go long. Your job is to keep each description brief and give the team people to follow up with.
