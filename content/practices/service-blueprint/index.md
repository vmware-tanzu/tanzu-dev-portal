## How to Use this Method

{{% section %}}
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Draw these rows on the whiteboard:

   |*Row Name* | *Steps 1 to n* |
   |----------------------------------|----|
   |Physical Evidence                   | ? | 
   |Customer Actions                    | ? | 
   |Frontstage                          | ? | 
   |Backstage - eg. services, databases | ? | 
   |<Any other points, eg. sensors>     | ? | 

   The customer/user actions row is always directly under physical evidence row. It is the user we are targeting; they are the “hero”.

   **Tip**: All projects/products are different, so you can always add different rows to the table as needed. See "Facilitator Notes & Tips" for a list possibilities.

1. Move column by column through time, filling in cells with:

   **Physical Evidence** — What does the user first see? The physical evidence is not the interface they see, it is a monitor or cell phone.

   **Customer Actions** — What action do they do to access the service? What do they do next?

   **Frontstage** — How is the service visibly delivered? When a service is delivered, what is the name of the page that the user sees?

   **Backstage** — What helps make the service happen? The user does not see or directly interact with this.

   **Other touch-points** — What needs to happen in order for the backend to receive the information?

1. Circle or star cells that:

   - Need more clarity through research and exploration
   - Need validation because there’s product risk
   - Are pain points which should be fixed or improved
   - Are opportunities to measure the quality of the service
   - Are opportunities for cost savings or increased profits
   - Are moments that are loved by the customer and should not be lost

### Facilitator Notes & Tips

Compared to a journey map, service blueprints focus more on the process than the customer experience.

Service blueprints are especially useful for:

- Multiple interactions spread over time (closing and re-opening an app)
- Many mediums of interaction, controlling physical products, customer service

Optional rows
   - _Time_ - some services are provided at different times or have steps that take varying amounts of time to complete
   - _Thoughts/Emotions_ - understanding emotions of fear/anxiety provides context to customer decisions      
   - _Phases_ - services can unfold over time; e.g. rent, use, return
   - _Split up Backstage_ - breaking backend technology into Employees, Data, Apps, Infrastructure, Name of Dept/Team can clarify various domains of the service      
   - _Photos / Sketches_ - the team can visualize a step using pictures or drawings
   - _Challenges_ - the team can discuss difficulties within the existing process      
   - _Ideas_ - the team can generate solutions that solve pains

Optional lines to draw between rows
   - _The line of interaction_ - this is the point at which customers and the service interact
   -  _The line of visibility_ - beyond this line, the customer can no longer see into the service
   -  _The line of internal interaction_ - this is where the business itself stops, and partners step in
