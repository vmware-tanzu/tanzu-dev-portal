why: 
- To come to an understanding of what went well (plus), and what could be changed to improve collaboration in future (delta)
- To introduce a regular feedback cycle at a 1:1 / individual level that allows for more personal feedback
- It focuses on a more frequent, smaller audience for feedback sessions, so it will be easier to organize, compared to a retrospective
- To allow the feedback to focus on individual actions rather than team / group based actions generated from a group setting
when:
- After the first day of pairing with someone first time
- With people who do not regularly provide input in larger meetings
- Start doing this daily, scale down to less frequent as both participants feel comfortable
what:
- In Person: pieces of paper and pen
- Remote: a way to share remote notes / Miro

### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Find a quiet area or zoom room with just the two of you
1. Set aside 3-5 minutes to think of any Pluses / Deltas during the day, ranging from small to large topics.
   
   For example (Plus): 
     - ‚ÄúWe handled that external meeting with the Security team well.‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúThanks for teaching me those keyboard shortcuts.‚Äù

   For example (Delta):
     - ‚ÄúWe did not take any breaks at all today.‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúI felt I did not get access to the keyboard very much during our pair-programming session today.‚Äù
     - I notice you always join meetings 5 minutes late, so we end up not ending the meeting on time.

   (Convert the above example into an image to break monotony.)
1. Take turns each going over a plus / delta, alternating between pluses and deltas.
1. Depending on the feedback, suggest changes for future working sessions.
   For example:
     - Let us ensure that tomorrow at 11 AM and 3 PM we take a 10 minute break.
     - Let us ensure we end meetings on time so we end up causing all our meetings to run over.
<!-- 2. You can embed images like this: 

   ![This is the default cover image as an example](/images/default-cover.png)
   
   Use [page bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/#page-bundles) for images, so they go in an `images` directory underneath the same directory that the index.md file is in.
   
   Try not to make them to large either in pixels or disk space. 1280px on the longest side and 400KB or so max.  -->
