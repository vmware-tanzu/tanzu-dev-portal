## How to Use this Method
### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Draw the primary persona on the whiteboard

   {{% callout %}}
   Tip: If necessary, you can split into groups first
   {{% /callout %}}
1. For each additional persona, draw:
   - A person
   - Their name
   - Write what keeps them up at night or a sentence that describes their goal

1. Draw arrows connecting other personas that work with the primary persona

   {{% callout %}}
   Tip: If desired, clarify the relationships by using verbs with arrows like "supports", "reports to", or "is supported by"
   {{% /callout %}}
#### Success/Expected Outcomes
The team has a shared understanding of all the users, what they care about, and how they relate to one another
