### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. Draw the primary persona on the whiteboard

   {{% /callout %}}
1. For each additional persona, draw:
   - A person
   - Their name
   - Write what keeps them up at night or a sentence that describes their goal

1. Draw arrows connecting other personas that work with the primary persona

   {{% callout %}}
   **Tip**: If desired, clarify the relationships by using verbs with arrows like "supports", "reports to", or "is supported by"
   {{% /callout %}}
