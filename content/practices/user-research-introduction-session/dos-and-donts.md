Biases to be aware of during interviews as well as several “dos & don’ts” to consider while conducting research.

{{% section %}}
### RESEARCH IS NOT...
* A demo to sell a product
* Word for word everything the user wants, sometimes known as “Requirements Gathering”. We look for pains, gaps and needs. We dig deeper to ask why they want something, when they last needed it & build a timeline for such functionality.

### RESEARCH BIASES
Biases can and will interfere with gathering valuable and accurate research. Be aware of the following biases:

* Social Desirability Bias (participant)
  * Answer questions in a way that will lead to them being liked & accepted \
_To counteract_: positive reinforcement of criticism or negative feedback
* Sponsor Bias (participant)
  * Feelings about the sponsor, such as a company, client, or stakeholder, may bias their answers \
_To counteract_: Stay neutral about sponsor feedback
* Confirmation Bias
  * Using participants answer to confirm their own belief. We tend to remember points that support our hypothesis and filter out points that disprove. \
_To counteract_: Re-evaluate participant's expressions, perform [research synthesis](practices/research-synthesis/) as a group, challenge preexisting assumptions
* Leading question and wording Bias
  * Elaborating on a participant's answer puts words into their mouth \
_To counteract_: Use participant’s own words, avoid summarizing and ask them to summarize once more instead

### RESEARCH INTERVIEW DOS AND DON'TS

Below is a list of interview dos and don’ts that you can go over with your team to help them craft questions that draw insightful information from people.

#### Do: Start the interview with simple questions. 
##### Don’t start with hard questions. Ease into them.

Starting with easy topics will help people get relaxed, comfortable, and talking.

{{< table "table" >}}
| Good Question | Bad Question | 
| ---- | ---- |
| Tell me a little bit about what you do? | You answered that you hate __ in our recruiting survey. Why do you hate ___ ? |
|  |  |
{{< table />}}

#### Do: Ask open-ended questions with “What”, “How” and “Why”.
##### Don’t ask leading questions or lead users through tasks.
##### Don’t ask questions with “Did”, “Is”, or “Would” that provide only yes or no answers.

The goal is to hear people speak in their own words as much as possible. It’s very easy for people to say they would buy your product until they actually have to pay. Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.

{{< table "table" >}}
| Good Question | Bad Question | 
| ---- | ---- |
| How are you doing? | Are you having a good day? |
| Can you tell me the whole story of? Then what? | Do you like this and find this helpful? |
| Why did you do that? |  |
| How did you do that? |  |
|  |  |
{{< table />}}

#### Do: Seek concrete stories, past actions & behaviors.
##### Don’t seek generalizations or ask about future behavior.

The goal is to understand what happened in their past to give us clues about why they think or feel things today.

{{< table "table" >}}
| Good Question | Bad Question | 
| ---- | ---- |
| Can you talk about the last time you used this? | Do you typically do this? |
| What did you do that time and why was it different? | What do you normally do? |
| What do you think about this product? | Would you pay for this? |
| Tell me about the last time you had a painful experience with this product. | What do you want? |
|  |  |
{{< table />}}

#### Do: Give people time to answer the question.
##### Don’t fill in silence with more questions.

The goal is to give people space to think because being interviewed is difficult. You can also use silence as a way to extract even more information that people may be hesitant to give. Related, also feel free to move forward if the conversation is digressing or come back to the question if someone is having a hard time answering.

{{< table "table" >}}
| Good Behavior | Bad Behavior | 
| ---- | ---- |
| _Silence_ | Interrupting while interviewee is speaking |
|  |  |
{{< table />}}

#### Do: Nod and say less. The interviewee is always right.
##### Don’t correct or contradict a research participant if they do something "wrong".

The goal is to get people speaking as honestly as possible and to encourage them to feel it’s okay when they don’t understand how to use something in an interview. Correcting interviewees makes them feel that they are being tested and they can easily become afraid to speak their mind for fear of looking dumb.

{{< table "table" >}}
| Good Interviewer Behavior |Bad Interviewer Behavior |
| ---- | ---- |
| User: This part doesn’t make sense. Is it supposed to do that?<br><br>Interviewer: What do you think it should do?<br><br>User: I think it would swap out all the pictures.<br><br>Interviewer: There is no actual answer here, we want to learn about what you expect. Thanks! | User: This part doesn’t make sense. Is it supposed to do that?<br><br>Interviewer: Oh, it's a slideshow and it's just broken in the prototype. You’re supposed to tap on the arrow and the next image should enter the page.<br><br>User: Oh I didn’t see that, sorry. |
|  |  |
{{< table />}}

#### Do: Actively listen and dig deeper with “why” questions.
##### Don’t ignore users when they are struggling in silence, or they show surprise. 
##### Dig deeper and ask why they are reacting a certain way.

The goal is to pay attention to the user as they are speaking and feel comfortable going off script when you see or hear something interesting. It can be easy to read straight off the script without asking follow up questions but it means that we miss out on something that may be valuable for us to know.

| Good Interviewer Behavior | Bad Interviewer Behavior |
| ---- | ---- |
| Interviewer: What do you think this page does?<br><br> User: Oh! I like that. Anyway, I think this page tells me my sleep duration.<br><br> Interviewer: Let’s rewind for a second, what did you mean by “Oh! I like that.”? | Interviewer: What do you think this page does?<br><br> User: Oh! I like that. Anyway, I think this page tells me my sleep duration.<br><br> Interviewer: Great, what would you do next? |
|  |  |

#### Do: Stay neutral about the product you are showing.
##### Don’t talk about or sell your product.

The goal with research is to have as unbiased feedback as possible. For example, interviewees should feel . Talking about your opinion, or even telling them what the product is supposed to do will subtly encourage interviewees to agree with you. Interviewees will feel inclined to be polite and make you feel good about your product to begin with.

{{< table "table" >}}
| Good Interviewer Behavior | Bad Interviewer Behavior |
| ---- | ---- |
| Interviewer: We’re interested in having you test drive an idea that's related to sleep cycles. | Interviewer: We’re working on this mobile app that gives you an easy way to look at how much sleep you’re getting at night. | 
|  |  |
{{< table />}}

#### Do: Wrap up with broad questions.
##### Don’t wrap up without having interviewees reflect on their experience.
Interviewees will have more to say. You can capture many interesting insights during the wrap-up.

| Good Interviewer Behavior | Bad Interviewer Behavior |
| ---- | ---- |
| How was this experience for you? Is there anything else pertaining to sleep that you’ve been thinking about lately? | We’ve got no more questions for you. Thanks, bye! |
