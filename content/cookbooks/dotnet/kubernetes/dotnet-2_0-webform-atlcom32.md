Running an ASP.NET 2.0 WebForm app that relies on a 32 bit COM library.

## Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` assumes that your solution is named COMClient and is placed at the same level as the `Dockerfile`. The `Dockerfile` also assume that you've published the application to the `bin\Release\Publish` folder.

The `Dockerfile` downloads and installs the VC++ redistributable in a special way due to the fact that the installer is asynchronous. The PowerShell `Start-Process` and `Wait-Process` Cmdlets synchronize the operation so the docker build doesn't terminate prematurely.

The `Dockerfile` then registers the ATL/COM DLL that the .NET 2.0 project depends on. Care is taken to use the 32-bit `regsvr.exe` which is located in `c:\Windows\SysWOW64`.

Just before putting the published artifacts into `c:\inetpub\wwwroot` 32-bit execution is enabled in IIS.

  ```bash
  FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:3.5
  SHELL ["powershell", "-Command", "$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue';"]

  # Register the ATL/COM dll
