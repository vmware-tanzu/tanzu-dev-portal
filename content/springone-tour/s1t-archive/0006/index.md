Day 2: Spring Tips: Configuration

Hi, Spring fans! Spring is an inversion-of-control container. Inversion of control insulates objects from the knowledge of how a collaborating object on which they depend are created. It also insulates objects from their environment, letting them exist blissfully unaware of where individual configuration properties such as passwords and URLs originate.

In this talk, we’re going to explore the Environment which connects objects to configuration properties. We’ll also look at PropertySources, profiles, @ConfigurationProperties, the @Value annotation, the Spring Cloud Config Server and Spring Cloud Vault for HashiCorp Vault.
