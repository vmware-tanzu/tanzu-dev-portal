A followup to [Cloud Native Architecture - Day 1](../0001)

It seems like a new cloud native technology or project is launched every week, and though there are technical changes required for building and operating cloud native applications, technology alone isn’t a silver bullet. It turns out that how you build your applications is critical to enable seamless scaling and resiliency to failures. What do you have to do to ensure your applications can fully leverage the power and flexibility the cloud offers?

The 12-Factor principles have been around for a decade and have proven to be core, foundational principles for cloud native applications. But they require changes to how you design your applications, the way teams collaborate on code, and more. Understanding the 12-Factor principles is a strong foundation for adopting cloud native patterns and practices.

Starting with an architectural kata, Nate and Jakub will event storm a possible solution stopping along the way to identify key quality attributes, fitness functions, and architectural patterns required to deliver a solution. Distributed architectures have similar problems and rather than “roll our own solutions,” we’ll leverage Spring Cloud to solve common challenges while lessening technical complexity.
