    <div class="h3 text-white">Responsible Microservices</div>
    <p>Hi, Spring fans! Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 imply a new baseline, bringing the Spring ecosystem in line with the needs of tomorrow‘s workloads. A huge part of that is the new baselines of Jakarta EE and Java 17 and the new support for GraalVM native images, based on the work of Spring Native. Join Spring Developer Advocates Josh Long (<a href="https://twitter.com/@starbuxman" target="_blank">@starbuxman</a>) and Dashaun Carter (<a href="https://twitter.com/@dashaun" target="_blank">@dashaun</a>) as we explore the implications of this exciting new technology for your Spring Boot applications and services.</p>
    <p>We‘ll look at things like using the GraalVM AOT compiler to produce native images that take up a markedly smaller memory footprint and start up in 10s or maybe hundreds of milliseconds. We‘ll look at how to containerize those workloads. We‘ll look at how to tame the GraalVM compiler when something goes wrong. And we‘ll look at how to teach GraalVM about your custom workloads.</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Responsible Microservices</div>
    <p>These days, you can’t swing a dry erase marker without hitting someone talking about microservices. Developers are studying Eric Evans' prescient book, Domain-Driven Design. Teams are refactoring monolithic apps, looking for bounded contexts and defining a ubiquitous language. And although there have been countless articles, videos, and talks to help you convert to microservices, few have spent any appreciable time asking if a given application should be a microservice. In this talk, I‘ll show you a set of factors you can apply to help you decide if something deserves to be a microservice or not. We’ll also look at what we need to do to maintain a healthy micro(services)biome.</p>

    <p>Layla is a .NET developer and has no idea of all the great and useful things that Spring has to offer. Jakub will be sharing his knowledge of Spring and dependency injection, covering IoC, Spring core, Spring tests, Spring Boot, and more. Through a collection of live demos, Jakub and Layla will guide you through some Spring fundamentals, why they're important, and when to use them (and when not to).</p>

Join me, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (<a href="https://twitter.com/@starbuxman" target="_blank">@starbuxman</a>), and we‘ll look at how Spring Boot makes writing blisteringly fast, cloud native, and scalable services more effortless than ever.

    <p>A sidecar isn’t a drink and you won’t find TAP at a bar. In this session, we’ll explore infrastructure architecture and how to create sidecars for your organization that help standardize access to functionality on VMware Tanzu Application Platform. We'll use many projects from the Spring portfolio.</p>
    <p>In this session, we'll look at how to combine HTTP, RSocket, and GRPC using Spring Cloud Function, RSocket Broker, Spring Cloud Gateway, and more to offer standard remote interfaces in a polyglot architecture. This can be built using Spring Boot and Spring Native and deployed via Cartographer on Tanzu Application Platform.</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Intro to Kubernetes</div>
    <p>If you’re working with just a few containers, managing them isn't too complicated. But what if you have hundreds or thousands? Think about having to handle multiple upgrades for each container, keeping track of container and node state, available resources, and more. That’s where Kubernetes comes in. Kubernetes is an open source container management platform that helps you run containers at scale. This talk will cover Kubernetes components and show how to run applications on it.</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Platform as a Product</div>
    <p>Most Ops groups can’t give developers what they need. Ops is limited by traditional service delivery mindset and tools. Stability and reliability are now table stakes when you’re releasing software daily. What developers need now from Ops is innovation. Operations rarely takes this innovation-driven, product approach to providing services and instead focuses on delivering to specification and limiting SLAs. As with development, Ops creates value with continuous operations, product managing their platforms, and releasing frequently. This talk covers how Ops groups are transforming from a service delivery mindset to a platform-as-a-product approach. With examples from Discover Financial Services, Rabobank, the U.S. Air Force, and others, the talk covers the concept, technologies, and tools commonly used, along with Ops tactics needed to kick off a platform-as-a-product strategy.</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Getting Started with GraphQL in Spring Boot</div>
    <p>Now that we deconstructed our monolithic application into a microservice architecture, all of our API calls are going through our gateway. This is great because all of our REST API endpoints are in a single place but we still have a problem.</p>
    <p>With web, mobile, and IoT applications each requiring different views of our data, how can we support them all? We could continue down the path we‘re on and add new endpoints each time a new requirement comes in, but there‘s a more scalable solution.</p>
    <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. In this session, you‘ll learn the basic concepts of GraphQL, and then learn how to use GraphQL in your Spring Boot applications with Spring for GraphQL. We‘ll add a GraphQL layer to WaffleCorp and let each of the clients tell us what they want and how they want it.</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Observability: Beyond the Three Pillars with Spring</div>
    <p>In this presentation, we‘ll explore the basics of the three pillars and what Spring has to offer to implement them for logging (SLF4J), metrics (Micrometer), and distributed tracing (Spring Cloud Sleuth, Zipkin/Brave, OpenTelemetry).</p>
    <p>We‘ll also talk about how to take your system to the next level, what else you can find in Spring and related technologies to look under the hood of your running system (Spring Boot Actuator, Logbook, Eureka, Spring Boot Admin, Swagger, Spring HATEOAS), and what our future plans are.</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Bootiful Kubernetes Operators</div>
    <p>You know what’s fun? Automating the ever livin’ heck out of infrastructure! Slaying that YAML! Nobody wants to painstakingly build something then spend weeks trying to write the YAML to describe it to the infrastructure. Thankfully, Kubernetes provides composability through abstractions like operators, controllers, and custom resource definitions. These days, it’s trivial to extend Kubernetes with a Spring Boot application, turn it into a GraalVM native image that runs in a Docker container, and then deploy that. Join us, and we’ll learn how to extend and automate Kubernetes with Spring Boot and Spring Native-powered custom operators and eliminate that ever-so-pesky YAML.</p>

<div id="supply-chain-choreography" class="talk-modal p-md-5 p-3">
    <div class="h3 text-white">Path to Production Using Supply Chain Choreography</div>
    <p>The Kubernetes ecosystem has a rich set of solutions for various stages of CI/CD. Tools like Flux, Tekton, kpack, Knative, ArgoCD, and more each enable big steps forward in establishing a modern path to production. And yet, the teams and organizations that adopt these tools still struggle with complex, DIY snowflake pipelines. The challenge can be creating and maintaining imperative scripts; orchestrating the flow of information between tools, driving reusability, adopting GitOps practices, and enabling proper separation of concerns.</p>
    <p>Cartographer is an exciting new OSS project that elegantly addresses these challenges, providing the backbone for a modern application platform built on top of Kubernetes. Rooted in the concept of declarative supply chain choreography, it focuses on creating composable, reusable roadmaps to drive source code to production. It provides an abstraction layer that facilitates the adoption and integration of existing and emerging CI/CD tools, while clearly delineating developer and operator ownership. It complements the existing ecosystem, filling an important gap to ease use, maintenance, and scalability.</p>
    <p>In this talk, we‘ll discuss supply chain choreography as a model for CI/CD and use Cartographer to explore how you can create secure and comprehensive pipelines, sustainably and at scale.</p>

    <p>What is Knative Serving, and how does it help you simplify and enhance the way that your application runs on Kubernetes? How does it work? What components are at play? In what ways is running an app on Knative superior to running it directly on Kubernetes? Join in the conversation as Whitney Lee discusses (and draws!) the answers to these questions and more!</p>

    <p>“TDD leads to a great design,” they said. “Mocking is bad,” they said. “Integration testing is slow,” they said. “Testable architecture to the rescue,” they said. “If you don’t test, don’t call yourself a developer,” they said. “Code coverage must be 100%,” they said. And so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>In this talk, we’ll tackle some of the testing gotchas. There will be live coding, architecture rants, some slides, and (hopefully) much fun. Both senior and junior developers should find something interesting in that testing example.</p>

Shortly after graduation Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of the skills she had just learned at school. However Whitney quickly developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, and a passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. She has made many light board videos for IBM Cloud, from topics ranging from creating a Pod in Kubernetes, to event-driven architecture, to cloud native API solutions. At VMware Whitney’s contagious excitement drives her to continue to explore, collaborate, teach, and play!</p>
