### Sample Agenda & Prompts
1. This is a numbered list of steps. With markdown, just keep using the `1.` and it'll automatically create the numbers.

   You'll often have multiple paragraphs in one step. Like this one.
   
   Just space them in 3 spaces `<space><space><space>` from the margin and they will fall under that step instead of creating a new step.

1. This will be the next step. It should render as `2`.

   {{< callout >}}
   Tip: This is a "callout". You can use it for Tips, Warnings, Info, Quotes, things like that. 
   {{< /callout >}}

1. You can embed images like this: 

   ![This is the default cover image as an example](/images/practices/default-cover.png)
   
   Images go in `/static/images/practices/<your-practice-folder>/the-image.png`
   
   Try not to make them to large either in pixels or disk space. 1280px on the longest side and 400KB or so max.
