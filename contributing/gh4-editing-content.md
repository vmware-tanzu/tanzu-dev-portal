# Tanzu Developer Center Contribution Guide


## Editing Content

Prior to submitting PR of a content post to the Tanzu Developer Center, all posts need to go through several formal reviews. The reviews which may be necessary for all posts are:


### My content needs to be reviewed prior to submission

1. **Technical review** (required) - Even if you are a subject matter expert for a particular piece of technology, all posts should first be reviewed for technical accuracy. The reviewer could be someone who is more knowledgable than you in the topic area. Or the reviewer could represent the audience you want to consume your content, and could review from a readability and understandability perspective.

2. **Copy Editing** (required for written content only) - Once reviewed for technical accuracy, all posts need to go through copy editing to ensure compliance with the [VMware style guide](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/brand/photography-only/guidelines/writing-and-naming/editorial-style-guide/marketing-editorial-style-guide.pdf) (**VMware employees only**) and the [TDC style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XsGW4hqRaPgSo7Ihh0-C8e6VjDbkVlWL7G6GgVK1SeQ/edit) (**VMware employees only**), as well as ensuring proper punctuation, grammar, voice, etc. 

    **NOTE**: for VMware employees, we have copy editors available on staff. Ask the team on [Slack](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C011DRHHDTL) if you need help. However, our copy editors do not work with GitHub, and prefer Google Docs (or Word of you don't have access to Google Docs). Keeping content in a markdown format is generally fine. If you are submitting your content via a GitHub pull request, **it is your responsibility to find a way to get your content into this format, edited by one of our editors, and back again**. 

3. **Legal Review** (may be required) (**VMware employees only**) - If your content deals with a VMware commercial product directly, or fi it includes forward looking statements about products or features, or if you think it might be required, submit your content for Legal review. This should be done after technical review and copy editing, and may require your content to go back through copy editing if the changes are significant.
