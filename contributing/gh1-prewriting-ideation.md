# Tanzu Developer Center Contribution Guide


## Pre-Writing / Ideation

Follow these processes if you need assistance prior to creating content. Example: coming up with content ideas, or ensuring your idea is right for the Tanzu Developer Center.


### I want to create content for the Tanzu Developer Center, but I **don’t** know what to write.

1. **Check the [content backlog](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal/projects/7)**. This is a GitHub kanban board where we track our content backlog, and content creation status. Use filters for “Content” + other technology options to discover topics of interest. **NOTE**: Options for content topics are not limited to what is on this board, nor do you have to stick exactly to these topics. They are there to give contributors ideas for content needs.
2. **Check with team at [#tanzu-developer-center](https://vmware.slack.com/archives/C011DRHHDTL) (VMware Employees Only)**. Regardless if you pick an option from the content backlog, or have your own idea, it is a good idea to check-in with the Tanzu Developer Center team to ensure the idea is likely to be accepted.
