## Code Contributions

If you are interested in contributing new features, bug fixes, or open issues, follow these steps:

1. Find an issue you want to work on either in an [open project](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal/projects), or an [open issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal/issues).
2. Fork the repo to your own git repository.
3. Create a new branch.
   ```
   git checkout -b $NEW_BRANCH
   ```
4. Write and test the feature locally. For information on building a local deployment of the Tanzu Developer Center, see the [Getting Started](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal/blob/main/README.md#getting-started) section of the [README.md](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-dev-portal/blob/main/README.md).
