    <div class="h3 text-white">Application Modernization: Migrating Mainframe Apps to the Cloud Using Spring</div>
    <p>Mainframes have been the engine for data processing for over 50 years, but we have reached that time where we move our applications off of the mainframe to new infrastructure, to the cloud, or a hybrid approach. But what tools do we have at our disposal to migrate our COBOL applications from the mainframe to these new platforms? This is where the Spring ecosystem provides the tools to help with this migration. In this discussion, we will show you how Spring and its ecosystem can help with migrating applications from the mainframe to your new platform. Projects such as Spring Batch, Spring Cloud, and Spring Boot, can be used to simplify this migration process. This is where the Spring ecosystem provides the tools to help with this migration.

    <p>Despite our best efforts, many software projects don’t end with champagne and cake. While some blame a bad technology choice, more often than not, the issues boil down to people problems. Traditional computer science education focuses on algorithms and languages while largely ignoring the human aspect of software and the sociology of organizations. Fear not friends, there are patterns and approaches that can help you win trust quickly, create allies, set expectations and effectively communicate during the ups and downs of project life.</p>
    <p>Dodging the pitfalls of software implementation can be taxing. How do we navigate the existing social complexity and interpersonal dynamics found in every organization? How do we earn trust, maintain rapport and turn clients into advocates? This talk will explore the challenges of building and maintaining software using examples from within and beyond the software industry to help give you the tools to chart a path to more than just a successful launch but a team that enjoys the journey.</p>

    <p>WaffleCorp is a major provider of breakfast products available direct to consumer or through our strategic
        partnerships. The current implementation of the e-commerce platform is a monolithic Spring MVC application that
        serves data through a collection of REST APIs.</p>
    <p>Currently, the only provider of the REST API is our e-commerce web application. We've been tasked with opening up
        our APIs to our new iOS and Android apps, partner microservices, and IoT applications.</p>
    <p>The issue we ran into is that a REST API is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We need a more flexible solution to
        meet the requirements of all of our client applications. This is a perfect use case for the speed and
        flexibility of GraphQL.</p>
    <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL
        provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for
        exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful
        developer tools.</p>
    <p>In this session, you’ll learn what GraphQL is and why you should consider it in your next project. You’ll learn
        how to use GraphQL in your Spring Boot applications by leveraging the Spring for GraphQL project. By the end of
        this session, you’ll understand how to stand up a GraphQL endpoint and request the data you need, and nothing

        now from Ops is innovation. Operations rarely takes this innovation-driven, product approach to providing
        services and instead focuses on delivering to specification and limiting SLAs. As with development, Ops creates
        value with continuous operations, product managing their platforms, and releasing frequently. This talk covers
        how Ops groups are transforming from a service delivery mindset to a platform-as-a-product approach. With

        frameworks like Spring not only make your life easier but help your teams deliver robust applications to
        production? Spring Cloud has a veritable plethora of sub projects from circuit breakers to functions simplifying
        the task of building cloud native applications while making it easy for developers to adhere to best practices.
        At the same time it can be overwhelming to get your head wrapped around all the features Spring offers. This

        the teams and organizations that adopt these tools still struggle with complex, DIY snowflake pipelines. The

        tools, driving reusability, adopting GitOps practices, and enabling proper separation of concerns.</p>
    <p>Cartographer is an exciting new OSS project that elegantly addresses these challenges, providing the backbone for
        a modern application platform built on top of Kubernetes. Rooted in the concept of declarative supply chain
        choreography, it focuses on creating composable, reusable roadmaps to drive source code to production. It
        provides an abstraction layer that facilitates the adoption and integration of existing and emerging CI/CD
        tools, while clearly delineating developer and operator ownership. It complements the existing ecosystem,

                Mutual Benefit, Whitney went back to school to learn full-stack web development. Shortly after
                graduation Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of the skills she had just
                learned at school. However Whitney quickly developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, and a
                passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. She has made many light board videos for
                IBM Cloud, from topics ranging from creating a Pod in Kubernetes, to event-driven architecture, to cloud
                native API solutions. At VMware Whitney’s contagious excitement drives her to continue to explore,
