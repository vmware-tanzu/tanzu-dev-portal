    <p>Mainframes have been the engine for data processing for over 50 years, but we've reached that time where we move
        our applications off of the mainframe to new infrastructure, to the cloud, or a hybrid approach. But what tools
        do we have at our disposal to migrate our COBOL applications from the mainframe to these new platforms? This is
        where the Spring ecosystem provides the tools to help with this migration. In this discussion, we'll show you
        how Spring and its ecosystem can help with migrating applications from the mainframe to your new platform.
        Projects such as Spring Batch, Spring Cloud, and Spring Boot can be used to simplify this migration process.

    <p>WaffleCorp is a major provider of breakfast products available direct to consumer or through our strategic
        partnerships. The current implementation of the e-commerce platform is a monolithic Spring MVC application that
        serves data through a collection of REST APIs.</p>
    <p>Currently, the only provider of the REST API is our e-commerce web application. We've been tasked with opening up
        our APIs to our new iOS and Android apps, partner microservices, and IoT applications.</p>
    <p>The issue we ran into is that a REST API is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We need a more flexible solution to
        meet the requirements of all of our client applications. This is a perfect use case for the speed and
        flexibility of GraphQL.</p>
    <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL
        provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for
        exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful
        developer tools.</p>
    <p>In this session, you’ll learn what GraphQL is and why you should consider it in your next project. You’ll learn
        how to use GraphQL in your Spring Boot applications by leveraging the Spring for GraphQL project. By the end of
        this session, you’ll understand how to stand up a GraphQL endpoint and request the data you need, and nothing

    <p>As developers, we want to be able to iterate and develop our applications while having to jump through the fewest
        hoops possible. With Spring Boot, we're able to do just that! Unfortunately, if you then want to deploy that
        Spring Boot app to Kubernetes, everything can come to a screeching halt quicky—you're suddenly knee deep in YAML
        as you struggle to not only deploy your application, but debug and test it as well. VMware Tanzu Application
        Platform is a developer-friendly Kubernetes platform that makes getting your app deployed to Kubernetes quick
        and painless. In a matter of minutes with a basic Git repo containing your code, you can have your app up and
        running on Kubernetes! Not only that, but you get an automated build pipeline that will continuously build and
        deploy your application and give you the ability to debug it right from your IDE! In this session, we'll show
        you everything you need to know about how to leverage Tanzu Application Platform to get to production on
        Kubernetes faster than you ever imagined!</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">TDD and the Terminator — An Introduction to Test Driven Development</div>
    <p>Getting started with Test Driven Development (TDD) can be very challenging. It requires a different mindset and
        approach to writing and developing code. However, once in that mindset, it is very difficult not to write tests
        first. But why bother writing tests first? In this session, we will go through the reasons for writing tests
        before coding, look at architecture and design principles, such as SOLID and see how it all comes together to
        create a more testable and maintainable application. I will show you how to get started writing tests first with
        practical examples on how to reprogram a T800 series Terminator so you can start using TDD in your own
        applications (or killer robots from the future). Hasta La Vista badly-written code!</p>

    <div class="h3 text-white">Level Up Your Integration Testing With Testcontainers</div>
    <p>Traditional approaches to integration testing—using shared, local, or in-memory databases—fall short for today's
        modern developer.</p>
    <p>Developers today are building cloud native distributed microservices and taking advantage of a rich variety of
        backing services. This explosion of applications and backing services introduces new challenges in creating the
        necessary environments for integration testing. To be useful and effective, these environments must be easy to
        create and they must resemble production as closely as possible. New solutions are needed to make this need a
        reality.</p>
    <p>Enter Testcontainers!</p>
    <p>Testcontainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests and makes it incredibly easy to create lightweight,
        throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker
        container.</p>
    <p>In this talk, you will learn when and how to use Testcontainers. We will cover the fundamentals and walk through
        a step-by-step example using a Spring Boot application that we build from scratch. As a bonus, we'll highlight
        some new features in Spring Boot 3.0 along the way!</p>

    <p>“TDD leads to a great design,” they said. “Mocking is bad,” they said. “Integration testing is slow,” they said.
        “Testable architecture to the rescue,” they said. “If you don’t test, don’t call yourself a developer,” they
        said. “Code coverage must be 100%,” they said. And so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>In this talk, we’ll tackle some of the testing gotchas. There will be live coding, architecture rants, some
        slides, and (hopefully) much fun. Both senior and junior developers should find something interesting in that
        testing example.</p>

            <p>Exploring new languages, frameworks, and technologies, and then sharing what he’s learned, has always
                come naturally to Ryan. Even when it wasn’t his day job, Ryan has always been driven by his passion,
                spending his time and energy educating his friends, colleagues, or anyone else that would listen.
                Currently, Ryan is working as a software engineer as part of the Spring Cloud team. Ryan has a passion
                for sharing what he learns via social media, including Twitter and his blog, as well as in person at
                conferences. When he’s not coding, Ryan likes spending time with his daughter, ice fishing, running

            <p>Whitney traveled the scenic route but is absolutely chuffed to have found her way to Kubernetes and cloud
                technologies. She began her professional career as a fine artist before owning her own photography
                business for over a decade. Then, after a year-long tour playing keys and singing harmonies in the band
                Mutual Benefit, Whitney went back to school to learn full-stack web development. Shortly after
                graduation Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of the skills she had just
                learned at school. However Whitney quickly developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, and a
                passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. She has made many light board videos for
                IBM Cloud, from topics ranging from creating a Pod in Kubernetes, to event-driven architecture, to cloud
                native API solutions. At VMware Whitney’s contagious excitement drives her to continue to explore,
                collaborate, teach, and play!</p>
