    <div class="h3 text-white">Application Modernization: Migrating Mainframe Apps to the Cloud Using Spring</div>
    <p>Mainframes have been the engine for data processing for over 50 years, but we have reached that time where we move our applications off of the mainframe to new infrastructure, to the cloud, or a hybrid approach.  But what tools do we have at our disposal to migrate our COBOL applications from the mainframe to these new platforms?  This is where the Spring ecosystem provides the tools to help with this migration.  In this discussion, we will show you how Spring and its ecosystem can help with migrating applications from the mainframe to your new platform.  Projects such as Spring Batch, Spring Cloud, and Spring Boot, can be used to simplify this migration process.  This is where the Spring ecosystem provides the tools to help with this migration.

        both tech stacks are coming together as a team.</p>
    <p>Layla is a .NET developer and has no idea of all the great and useful things that Spring has to offer. Jakub will
        be sharing his knowledge of Spring and dependency injection, covering IoC, Spring core, Spring tests, Spring

    <div class="h3 text-white">Getting Started with GraphQL in Spring Boot</div>
    <p>WaffleCorp is a major provider of breakfast products available direct to consumer or through our strategic
        partnerships. The current implementation of the e-commerce platform is a monolithic Spring MVC application that
        serves data through a collection of REST APIs.</p>
    <p>Currently, the only provider of the REST API is our e-commerce web application. We've been tasked with opening up
        our APIs to our new iOS and Android apps, partner microservices, and IoT applications.</p>
    <p>The issue we ran into is that a REST API is not a one-size-fits-all approach. We need a more flexible solution to
        meet the requirements of all of our client applications. This is a perfect use case for the speed and
        flexibility of GraphQL.</p>
    <p>GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL
        provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for
        exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful
        developer tools.</p>
    <p>In this session, you’ll learn what GraphQL is and why you should consider it in your next project. You’ll learn
        how to use GraphQL in your Spring Boot applications by leveraging the Spring for GraphQL project. By the end of
        this session, you’ll understand how to stand up a GraphQL endpoint and request the data you need, and nothing
        more.</p>

        Thankfully, Kubernetes provides composability through abstractions like operators, controllers, and custom

    <p>Most Ops groups can’t give developers what they need. Ops is limited by traditional service delivery mindset and
        tools. Stability and reliability are now table stakes when you’re releasing software daily. What developers need
        now from Ops is innovation. Operations rarely takes this innovation-driven, product approach to providing
        services and instead focuses on delivering to specification and limiting SLAs. As with development, Ops creates
        value with continuous operations, product managing their platforms, and releasing frequently. This talk covers
        how Ops groups are transforming from a service delivery mindset to a platform-as-a-product approach. With
        examples from Discover Financial Services, Rabobank, the U.S. Air Force, and others, the talk covers the

    <p>These days, you can’t swing a dry erase marker without hitting someone talking about microservices. Developers
        are studying Eric Evans' prescient book, Domain-Driven Design. Teams are refactoring monolithic apps, looking
        for bounded contexts and defining a ubiquitous language. And although there have been countless articles,
        videos, and talks to help you convert to microservices, few have spent any appreciable time asking if a given
        application should be a microservice. In this talk, I‘ll show you a set of factors you can apply to help you

    <p>With globally distributed applications (and teams!) the job of software architect isn’t getting any easier;
        applications are growing increasingly complex and architects are spread thin. You can’t be involved with every
        decision, you must empower your teams while ensuring they are making good choices. How do you do that? How can
        frameworks like Spring not only make your life easier but help your teams deliver robust applications to
        production? Spring Cloud has a veritable plethora of sub projects from circuit breakers to functions simplifying
        the task of building cloud native applications while making it easy for developers to adhere to best practices.
        At the same time it can be overwhelming to get your head wrapped around all the features Spring offers. This
        talk will show how Spring allows architects to focus on the critical design decisions they need to make while
        ensuring developers are empowered to implement critical business use cases. Today’s cloud native applications
        have similar pitfalls, luckily Spring is here to help you resolve them!</p>

    <p>The Kubernetes ecosystem has a rich set of solutions for various stages of CI/CD. Tools like Flux, Tekton, kpack,
        Knative, ArgoCD, and more each enable big steps forward in establishing a modern path to production. And yet,
        the teams and organizations that adopt these tools still struggle with complex, DIY snowflake pipelines. The
        challenge can be creating and maintaining imperative scripts; orchestrating the flow of information between
        tools, driving reusability, adopting GitOps practices, and enabling proper separation of concerns.</p>
    <p>Cartographer is an exciting new OSS project that elegantly addresses these challenges, providing the backbone for
        a modern application platform built on top of Kubernetes. Rooted in the concept of declarative supply chain
        choreography, it focuses on creating composable, reusable roadmaps to drive source code to production. It
        provides an abstraction layer that facilitates the adoption and integration of existing and emerging CI/CD
        tools, while clearly delineating developer and operator ownership. It complements the existing ecosystem,
        filling an important gap to ease use, maintenance, and scalability.</p>

            <p>Whitney traveled the scenic route but is absolutely chuffed to have found her way to Kubernetes and cloud
                technologies. She began her professional career as a fine artist before owning her own photography
                business for over a decade. Then, after a year-long tour playing keys and singing harmonies in the band
                Mutual Benefit, Whitney went back to school to learn full-stack web development. Shortly after
                graduation Whitney was employed by IBM as a cloud developer, using none of the skills she had just
                learned at school. However Whitney quickly developed an insatiable appetite for all things cloud, and a
                passion for teaching others as she acquired knowledge herself. She has made many light board videos for
                IBM Cloud, from topics ranging from creating a Pod in Kubernetes, to event-driven architecture, to cloud
                native API solutions. At VMware Whitney’s contagious excitement drives her to continue to explore,
                collaborate, teach, and play!</p>
